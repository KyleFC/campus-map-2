The handbell program at Concordia University is internationally respected for its high-quality and richly-varied performances. The program offers a breadth of opportunities for ringers and future directors. A handbell quartet and options for private lessons and private coaching are also part of the program.

This ensemble is open to anyone interested in ringing handbells. Rehearsals are Monday and Wednesday from 6:30-7:30 p.m.
