FAQ
‌
I don’t have an official high school transcript. What should I do?

We have included a sample transcript for your parent, legal guardian, or administrator of your homeschool organization to create and sign, vouching for your units. Please have your transcript sent in a sealed envelope to:

Concordia University Irvine
Undergraduate Admissions Office
1530 Concordia West
Irvine, CA 92612

Note: In the absence of a high school transcript, we will accept an official GED or the California Proficiency Exam, but this may limit scholarship opportunities without the presence of a GPA.

‌
What does it mean for a transcript to be considered “official?”

The transcript should be sent in a sealed envelope with a signature from a parent, legal guardian, or homeschool director/administrator.

The transcript should be organized by grade level (9th-12th) and year.

Completed and in-progress courses should be accompanied by credits, units, or hours and include a letter grade or a numerical grade.

‌
What does it mean for a transcript to be considered “final?”

To be considered a final transcript, please include a graduation date, (month/day/year) and a signature from a parent, legal guardian, or the director of your organization.

‌
If I graduate from high school with a completed A.A. degree or over 30 units of college credit, am I still considered a freshman?

For admission, class standing (Freshman or Transfer) is determined by your high school graduation date. Please send any and all college transcripts along with your high school transcript for evaluation.
