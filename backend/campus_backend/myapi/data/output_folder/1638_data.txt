Outstanding Graduates 2020

Concordia University Irvine presents this award to one member of each class of graduating seniors. The honoree is chosen by vote of the faculty from a list of students who have demonstrated outstanding qualities in academic and personal achievement.

The criteria for selection are:

Exemplary Christian lifestyle
Active involvement in activities of the student body
Outstanding contributions to the university community
Academic GPA of at least 3.00

After several rounds of voting, two finalists each had an equal number of votes. When this occurred two times, it was decided that this year’s award would be shared by two graduates.

Haley Katherine Babineau
This student has consistently demonstrated dedication to her field of study in her work ethic, her application of knowledge, and her service to society. She is a true example of a servant leader; she deeply cares about others, shares her faith, and lovingly teaches children about our Savior. She exemplifies what it means to be a wise, honorable, and cultivated citizen.

Dr. Cari Chittick

Previous Testimonial for Haley

Next Testimonial for Haley
Maia Caitlin Jorgensen
She has quite the personality-always smiling and lifting others up. In academics, she is an avid participant, has a great work ethic and is beyond responsible. She is a student you wish you could have all the time. She has become an excellent marketer and I think the business background will do her very well in church work. She has a grace and humility that shows through in her actions.

Prof. Carolyn Shiery
