MASTER OF ARTS IN THEOLOGY
Christ College
EXPLORE 
Master of Arts in Theology
Christ College

Pursue advanced theological study for academic, professional, or personal development at Concordia University Irvine’s Master of Arts (MA) in Theology program. A confessional, orthodox, and missional university, we take seriously the Gospel of Jesus Christ and Christian faithfulness without compromising academic integrity. Every graduate theology program teaches from a certain perspective. Ours is a biblical one.

The Master’s in Theology degree is delivered through a “blended” instructional approach that offers flexibility for distance learners who live outside of the Orange County area. Blended instructional models are growing in popularity because adult students appreciate periodic face-to-face classroom connection times while being able to complete coursework primarily online. That means less time on campus, more time online, and the flexibility to fit continuing education into your home, family, and work life.

Students from a wide variety of Christian denominations have thrived in our graduate programs, going on to PhD’s and professorships in top universities, publishing books, and successfully serving in ministry.

Program Highlights
Academic master's degree. Designed as a Master of Arts program, versus a seminary’s Master of Divinity (M.Div.) curriculum, our MA in Theology is a 32-unit degree, similar to most other academic master's degree programs.
Solid curricular foundation with specific applications. The core of the MA Theology curriculum is supplemented with customizable emphases, electives, guided readings, and thesis research to meet your particular needs and interests.
Real-time online and face-to-face instruction. The majority of our courses are delivered in a live, real-time online format, enabling you to enroll in the program without relocating.
Convenient scheduling with on-campus summer intensives. Summer courses are taught on campus in nine-day intensive formats, enabling our distance students to spend time on our beautiful campus for meaningful experiences.
Committed faculty of scholar-teachers. You will be taught and mentored by professors who are committed to faithful biblical teaching, to the historical Christian faith, to life in Christ’s Church, and to the life of the intellect.
No specific major or GRE requirement. We believe that your aptitude for graduate-level study can be determined without the need for a more general examination. Therefore, our program does not require the GRE for admission.
Open to qualified students of all religious affiliations. Regardless of your background and religious affiliation, you will be welcomed, respected, and challenged to think, reflect, and learn in our program.
Program Timelines

Due to the flexibility and ability to customize your program, contact an admissions counselor to discuss upcoming start dates and how to plan your coursework. The MA program generally runs for a 15-week term during the fall and spring semesters and for a 9-day summer intensive.

If you are pursuing certifications with the Cross-Cultural Ministry Center or other programs with oversight by The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, there may be different term lengths to understand within your expanded coursework beyond the MA in Theology.

Curriculum

The core of the MA Theology curriculum will equip you with a solid foundation in research skills and the major divisions of theology. This is supplemented with customizable emphases, electives, guided readings, and thesis research to meet your particular needs and interests. 

You will be equipped with modern research tools, including your own personal copy of Logos Bible Software® (Bronze package; retail value over $600) and access to our library of 77,000 books, hundreds of journals, and thousands of e-books.

SAMPLE COURSES
THL 501: Introduction to Theological Research
2

This course will examine the essential methods and resources for the academic study of theology with attention given to research methods for projects that do not require an academic thesis. Procedures for identifying, proposing, researching, organizing, writing, and defending the thesis or project will be covered as students are guided in beginning their research.


THL 504: Survey of Historical Theology
3

This course will give an introduction to historical theology and a survey of the development of the theological formulations of the church with an emphasis on "challenges to orthodoxy" laid upon the church at various times and the role such events played in the church's confessional responses to enhance the student's understanding of the church's theological and doctrinal tasks today.


THL 511: Creeds and Confessions
3

Through a study of the major confessions of the Christian church, this course will center on the Ecumenical Creeds and the Book of Concord as other confessional documents will be considered in relationship to these confessional statements. The historical setting and theological content of these documents will be explored along with their contemporary use and application. Students seeking ministry certification in The Lutheran ChurchÃ¢â¬â¢Missouri Synod (LCMS) should take THL 510 instead of this course.


THL 528: Seminar in Biblical Theology and Exegesis
3

This seminar course will cover the Canon, inspiration of Scripture, and major themes in the Old and New Testaments using appropriate exegetical methods for interpreting various literary genres within the Bible.


THL 565: Christianity, Ethics and Contemporary Culture
3

This course will explore morality and ethics in light of scriptural teachings concerning creation and redemption as students are oriented to the main approaches, both traditional and contemporary, of non-biblical philosophical ethics and how Christian faith interacts with these approaches. The significance for ethics of the Lutheran confessional distinction between GodÃ¢â¬â¢s left and right hand rule will be explored in depth as students pursue an ethics research project tailored to their overall master's program.


THL 573: Systematic Doctrinal Theology
3

In this course students will pursue graduate-level study of systematic doctrinal theology from a biblical perspective through the survey of loci, i.e., the topics, of doctrinal theology, and consider the nature and task of theological reflection; responsibilities and qualities of a theologian; and key topics in theological reflection such as the Person and Work of Christ, Justification, Law and Gospel, the Trinity, Creation, the Word of God, the Last Things, Christian vocation, and the life of the Christian church. Special attention will be given to recognizing and characterizing the church-related context in which and for which theology is undertaken.
