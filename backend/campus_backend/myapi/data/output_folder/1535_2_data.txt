stions regarding ARP (HEERF III).

Funding & Expenditure Reporting

Under the American Rescue Plan (ARP), Concordia University Irvine received $4,761,375 in funding through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund Phase III (HEERF III), committing to provide no less than $2,396,150 of the funding in emergency grants directly to students whose lives and education have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak, prioritizing those students with exceptional need.

In an effort to distribute funds quickly to the students with exceptional need, block funding will be used for the distribution of HEERF III grants. To determine which students receive initial, block emergency grants and how much they would receive under Section 314(a)(1) or ARP, Concordia University Irvine will create a distribution formula for Pell Grant eligible students enrolled on or after March 13, 2021. Exceptional need will be determined using the following Formula: Cost of Attendance minus Expected Family Contribution (EFC) minus Total Gift Aid from all sources = remaining need. Once Pell Grant eligible students are determined at the beginning of August, emergency grants will be awarded, which may be used for any component of the studentâ€™s cost of attendance or for emergency costs that arise due to coronavirus, such as tuition, food, housing, health care (including mental health care) or child care.

Once the initial, block emergency grants are distributed to the students identified with exceptional need, the university will determine the methodology for distributing the remainder of the HEERF III student grants.
