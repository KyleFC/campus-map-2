6th Annual Business Plan Competition
CONCORDIA BUSINESS PLAN COMPETITION
Sixth Annual Cornelius Business Plan Competition

The Sixth Annual Concordia Business Plan Competition was held through an online forum on Saturday March 27th, 2021, and was a great success! Ten undergraduate students competed for $10,000 in CASH prizes. This is also the first year we held a High School Division which included twenty one participants. All of these teams submitted complete business plans on a business startup idea and presented them to a panel of judges in a “Shark Tank-like” setting.
