Director of Christian Education (DCE) Certification with Online Bachelor's Degree in Christian Education Leadership
ONLINE BACHELOR'S DEGREE
Degree. Certification. Online.

The Christian Education Leadership Degree (CEL) with Director of Christian Education (DCE) Certification is an online program suitable for students already working in a relevant ministry position in a church or church-related context. It is aimed at enhancing your leadership skills to prepare for a career certified by the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS). Start your journey with us by earning a bachelor’s, or complement an existing degree with a second BA and DCE certification. Upon completion of the entire program, you will have a Bachelor of Arts degree in Christian Education Leadership and be eligible for DCE Certification.

This program draws upon a rich theological tradition to explore the interface between leadership, culture and theology. Learning from professors who are well-respected throughout the Concordia University System, the DCE program will help nurture your personal, spiritual and professional growth. After completing your degree and internship requirements, you will be eligible to receive a call to serve an LCMS church as a DCE.

The Director of Christian Education program not only allows for an individual to be called in The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, but also allows for an individual to obtain a deeper and greater knowledge of God's Word for the benefit of that individual's faith and current or future ministry.
