Project Giving Light
CONCORDIA serves

Nearly one hundred times a day, a child in California is placed in foster care. There are more than 3000 children in foster care in Orange County right now.

More than 260,000 students in California’s public schools experience homelessness every year.

These children live in survival mode, surrounded by a haze of overwhelm. It is an environment of dream deprivation. This impacts their future in powerful ways: For students in foster care, only 53% will graduate on time.

A homeless youth without a high school diploma is 346% more likely to become a homeless adult.

We get to be part of the solution:

WE INTERRUPT THE HAZE OF OVERWHELM WITH AN INFUSION OF JOY & LIGHT WITH OUR BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS AND BIRTHDAY BOXES!

Light changes the darkness. It doesn’t ask for permission, it shows up and darkness is transformed. We want every child to know that they were made for a purpose, to speak hope, joy and blessings over them, and to infuse whatever space they call “home” with LIGHT & JOY so that they begin to dream about more than just surviving. Most importantly, we want every child to know that God loves them, He sees them, they matter to Him, and they are not alone.

THIS IS OUR MISSION: TO BRING JOY & LIGHT THROUGH BIRTHDAY CELEBRATIONS.

TOGETHER, we are making a difference.

Join the mission and give light.

 Tuesday, September 26, 2023, 8:15am - 11:30am
