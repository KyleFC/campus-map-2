INTERVIEWING
Center for Career & Vocation
Purpose

The ability to articulate your experience in a way that is meaningful to this particular employer.

The employer already has a vague notion that you can do the job or else they would not bring you in for an interview. Now, they need you to inspire confidence that will confirm their initial instincts about you were on point. Specifically, the interview process needs to assure the employer that:

You have the specific knowledge, skills (soft and hard), and abilities to perform the job duties
You have the motivation/initiative to do the job
You will work well with the team/clients and demonstrate emotional intelligence
You have problem-solving skills and can offer solutions to company pain points
Interview Prep

Research the company and know the job description by exploring the companyâ€™s website, social media channels, youtube videos, etc.

In order to tailor your message to this employer, you have to understand who they are (see the corporate website, about us page, mission statement, press releases, social media accounts) and have a firm grasp on the key qualities they are seeking in a candidate. Most job descriptions will ask for 50 different things, but you can usually group these into three to five major skill areas (hard and soft skills).

Write down questions that you may want to ask during the interview.
