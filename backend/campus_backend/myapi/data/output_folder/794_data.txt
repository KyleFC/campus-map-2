We have a new booking system!

To schedule an in-class instruction or 1:1 research appointment, please create an account with the library's WC Online platform using your Concordia email. Once you have an account and have selected the librarian schedule, you can select your day, approximate time, and an available librarian to reserve your appointment. We can also be reached at librarian@cui.edu for further questions or inquiries.
