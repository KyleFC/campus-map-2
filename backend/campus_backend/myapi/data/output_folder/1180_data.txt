Why We Serve
Heritage Garden Cleanup
CONCORDIA serves

Established in 2013, this 5-acre garden aims to bless others by cultivating a space for students, faculty, staff, and community to lead, to learn, and to serve. We accomplish this mission by serving as a venue for Educational Outreach, Student and Faculty Research, Undergraduate Classes, and Community Service events. Harvested fruits and vegetables are donated to the University’s café.

The site consists of a 40-bed community garden, greenhouse, 30-tree fruit and nut orchard, apiary, prayer garden, and spaces devoted to the cultivation of native Southern California plants. The Heritage Garden is directed by Tyler Zarubin who holds an M.Sc. in Zoology and is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Biology. The Heritage Garden is operated entirely by Concordia students who maintain the grounds, coordinate outreach and service events, and facilitate student research. Our work is supported both by Concordia University and through the generous donations of our community.
