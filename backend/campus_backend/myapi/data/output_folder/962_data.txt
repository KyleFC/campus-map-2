Q&A with Lucas

Where are you from?
I'm originally from Hesperia, CA.

What did you study in college?
I studied General Psychology with a minor in Religion.

What is your favorite place to eat in Irvine?
You can never go wrong with Chick-fil-A! I recommend the spicy chicken sandwich with an XL lemonade to wash it down.

What do you like to do with your free time?
My wife and I love watching movies and taking our dog, Roadie, on bike rides!

What advice do you have for students going through the admissions process?
Never be afraid to ask questions. With this being such an important decision for your life, we want to encourage you to make the best choice for YOU!
