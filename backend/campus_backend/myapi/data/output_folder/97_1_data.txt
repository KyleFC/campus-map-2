Kimberly Persiani: Early Online Advocate

Dr. Kimberly Persiani remembers living in San Francisco in 2001 while getting her EdD in International and Multicultural Education. To help pay the bills, she landed a part-time gig teaching a UC Santa Cruz extension course — but the commute was too far. “I asked if they would let me teach the class online using an online teaching system I had heard about,” Persiani says. “They said, ‘Sure, go for it, see how it works.’”

Erika Lopez

Although she earned her bachelor’s degree in Liberal Studies at Concordia University Irvine, it wasn’t until she was working on her teaching credential that Erika Lopez’s aspirations really began to bloom. She began the program to earn her Multiple Subject teaching credential, while working as a special education paraprofessional for La Habra City School District. Soon, Lopez recognized, “I fell in love with special ed and knew this is where my heart was. I felt so passionate about the field of special education.”

Master Teacher: Greg McFall

Greg McFall, MAED ’07 came from three generations of teachers, but it took him a while to find his own way into the classroom. When he did, he was named California Teacher of the Year for his innovative and relational teaching style at public schools in Orange County.

Kati Bennett named High School Teacher of the Year

Kati Bennett was named High School Teacher of the Year for the Capistrano Unified School District, in part because of a program she created in a Concordia University class. The program, called Student to Student, helps English as a second language (ESL) students integrate into the public high school environment.
