Mission Statement

As representatives of Christ who made all human life with inherent and eternal value, Eagles4Life seeks to be for life through education, service, and outreach. In partnership with the national Y4Life organization, club members affirm the value of human life through both on-campus involvement and collaboration with other life-oriented groups. We offer diverse volunteer opportunities, and our relationship with Y4Life allows our members to attend national retreats and conferences.
