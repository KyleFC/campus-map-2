Financial Aid (aid you accepted on your financial aid award letter)

Financial Aid: You will need your Financial Aid Award Letter for this section. If you have Stafford loans (subsidized or unsubsidized), 2% may be subtracted from the total loan amount. This is an estimate of the fees your lender will deduct to process your loan. Please keep in mind that Federal Stafford and PLUS loans require additional paperwork to be completed (Master Promissory Note, Entrance Exam, etc) in order to finalize and disburse the loans. Loans will not be disbursed unless all of your documentation is complete.

Estimating Direct Costs Due
Direct Costs

This category includes tuition, Housing and Meal Plans, and other charges that are paid directly to Concordia University.

Tuition: The cost of your classes
Housing and Meal Plans: You may choose to live on-campus and eat in our dining facilities. A variety of meal plans are offered and the cost varies based on what plan you select.
Fees: Concordia charges additional fees for other services, class fees, applied music, graduation, etc. These fees are due and payable upon assessment. Please refer to the General Catalog for a list of class fees designated by your major.
Deposits: Tuition Deposits will be credited to your account.
Applied Music (Private) Lessons: If applicable, please contact the Bursar's Office at (949) 214-3075 or email bursar@cui.edu.
Previous Balances: Continuing Students, please contact the Bursar's Office to check on previous balances at (949) 214-3075 or email bursar@cui.edu.
Indirect Costs

These expenses are not paid directly to Concordia but might be associated while attending Concordia.

Books and Supplies: Individual book costs vary greatly, depending on the courses you are taking. You may be able to purchase used books to lower the cost. Some classes also require supplies, others-course material, printing, etc.
Room and board: If you choose to live off-campus, you will need to budget for monthly rent, furnishing, utilities, and your meals. You may want to share an apartment with other students to alleviate the cost. Now is the time to fine-tune your cooking skills. It's expensive to eat out all the time.
Transportation: If you commute, be sure to factor in the cost of public transportation, gas, and car insurance. Don't forget the cost of breaks and holiday travel. For example, think about how many times you'll want to go home. You can lower these costs by carpooling or shopping around for student rates on airfare.
Payment Options (If you have a "Balance Due")
Federal Parent PLUS Loan: (Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students) is an affordable, low-interest loan designed for parents. With the PLUS Loan, you can borrow up to your child's total cost of education minus other financial aid awarded to the student.
Alternative Loans: An Educational Loan made in the
