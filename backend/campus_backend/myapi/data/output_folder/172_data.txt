Academic Coaching Center

The Writing Studio

Writing Consultants support students in their development as writers and critical thinkers. In one-on-one sessions, they provide feedback on papers for topics like the strength of claims, quality of research and evidence integration, organization and structure, formatting, adherence to the assignment prompt, and genre conventions. Schedule a Writing Studio session.

In addition, we partner with faculty and staff in offices such as Academic Advising, First-Year Experience, and the Disability Access Services to encourage, inspire, motivate, and support the academic success of each student.

If interested in becoming an academic coach or writing consultant, visit the Tutoring Services or Writing Studio application pages.
