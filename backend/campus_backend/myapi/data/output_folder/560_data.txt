Mission Statement

To promote the sport of Ultimate Frisbee through competitive and enjoyable games. It's an opportunity for friends and students to get together and play Frisbee, regardless of skill level. Our goal is to build friendships, promote good sportsmanship, build character, grow in athletic skill, and offer a means to get away from school and homework; relieve stress; hold a higher standard of Christian living during the course of play (such as modesty and kindness of words and actions).
