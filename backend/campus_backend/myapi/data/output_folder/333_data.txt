STUDENT LEADERSHIP
Student Activities

LEAD Student Activities serves the entire student body by promoting student involvement and coordinating opportunities for students to engage in all student campus events on and off campus.

Annual activities often include:

Beach Bash
Silent Disco
Fall Festival
Kindergarten Day
Basket BINGO

The LEAD Student Activities coordinators host fun events throughout the year that allow students to be socially integrated into the campus community and develop a sense of belonging, which is critical in enhancing their Concordia experience.

LEAD Student Activities encourages you to get out of your comfort zone, attend their events and begin building relationships with your peers!

Beach Bash

Beach bash is a annual tradition in August put on by our student activities team to kick off the year. All undergraduate students are invited to Corona Del Mar beach to have some good food, play games and compete for Hunt points, and end the night with a bonfire, s’mores, and worship!

Silent Disco

Silent disco is a fun event where students are each given a headset and they are able to sync up music with their friends. There is also a free dessert truck for students to enjoy while they dance!

Basket Bingo

Basket Bingo is an event for students to win baskets of free items! Our student activities team puts together different themed baskets for students to win based on their bingo cards. It is many of our students’ favorite event!
