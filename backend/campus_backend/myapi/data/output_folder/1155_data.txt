Preparing for Your Audition
Audition Specifics

Once you have applied for a Music Scholarship by completing our Music Scholarship Interest Form, you are ready to schedule a music audition. When scheduling auditions, please request any combination of the following:

Voice auditions for Choir - Dr. Michael Busch
Band or orchestral auditions for strings, woodwinds, brass, & percussion - Dr. Jeff Held
Handbell auditions - Professors Alex Guebert and Erik Der
Worship Band or Commercial Music ensemble auditions for guitar, electric bass, keyboard, drums - Prof. Steve Young
Composition auditions - Dr. Tom Mueller
Jazz & Americana ensemble auditions - Dr. Tom Mueller
Piano & organ auditions - Dr. Tom Mueller

Students interested in Theatre auditions will coordinate with our Theatre department.

Students are encouraged to audition as early as possible in order to take advantage of premium music scholarship opportunities. Your music scholarship will require specific commitments to one or more music areas. Usually, private lessons are also required at a very low cost of approximately $100 per semester. Scholarship funds tend to diminish in the later months of spring. Music scholarships will continue to be awarded until all section positions are filled.

Schedule an Audition

To schedule an online audition, please complete our Music Scholarship Interest Form and then contact auditions@cui.edu with your preferred weekday audition date. This is your opportunity, as a prospective student, to share your experience as a musician with Concordiaâ€™s music faculty. Auditions will be accepted through the summer, with priority funding through May 1. We welcome auditions from any student within one year of their potential enrollment.
