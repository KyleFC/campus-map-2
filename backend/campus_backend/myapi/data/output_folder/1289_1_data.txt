critically and biblically about trending cultural topics. By participating with others in this way, they might expand their understanding of the world while growing in wisdom.

We believe in interesting conversations, deep questions, breaking bread, and hearty laughter. Crosswise seeks to inspire students to be the conversation-starters in their own neighborhoods, families, sports teams, and schools. In short, the Crosswise team hopes you will join the effort to think biblically about our cultureâ€™s most pressing issues.
