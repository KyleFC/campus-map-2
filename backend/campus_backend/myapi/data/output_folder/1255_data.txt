Katie Shares:

This is a great opportunity to serve and make money for college. The program works with you to provide a steady income, make strong connections in your community, and gain work experience while in college.

What have you gained from your College Corps experience thus far?

I have gained significant experience working with kids, which has encouraged me to continue pursuing my teaching credential.

Hoping to pursue a career in education, Katie Crowder was searching for a program that would offer job experience working with children. The College Corps program provided exactly that. Katie serves as a dance tutor for students in grades 5-8 at The Wooden Floor in Santa Ana, an educational and dance center aimed at transforming the lives of young people in low-income communities. The program helped Katie hone her teaching skills which has affirmed her career goals. She is appreciative of the opportunity to serve, make strong community connections, and gain work experience all while earning a steady income for college.
