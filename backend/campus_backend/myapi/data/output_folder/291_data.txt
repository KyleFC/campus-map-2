Our campus is located within a gated community in one of the most scenic parts of Orange County. So whether you choose to live in a suite-style residence hall, a themed Living Learning Community (LLC), or an apartment-style residence hall (normally inhabited by juniors and seniors), you’re sure to enjoy beautiful mountain views, a sense of serenity, and access to amenities like ping-pong, and our CU Active fitness center, not to mention proximity to your friends and whatever TV show you decide to binge watch together (or video game you decide to play). You’ll find a caring, intimate community where you’ll feel safe, are known personally, and are empowered to thrive in key areas of life at our Christian residential campus.
