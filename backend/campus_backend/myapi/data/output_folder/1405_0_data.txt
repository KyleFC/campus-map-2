Degree posting is not automatic and all students who wish to have their degree posted must complete an Application for Graduation. This is necessary regardless of intent to participate in the commencement ceremony. It is the student's responsibility to submit the following to the Registrar's Office before the posted deadlines.

Meeting the application deadline is very important to ensure there isn't a delay in getting your degree posted. Late applications will jeopardize your eligibility to receive awards and participate in commencement.
