The Value of a College Minor

By declaring a minor, you’ll have the opportunity to pursue interests that might lie outside of your major. Gaining extra knowledge in an area that interests you can also help you in your future career! Not only will your skills and knowledge be more well-rounded, but you’ll also prove to future employers that you’re willing to work hard and exceed their expectations.

Curriculum

So that students are compliant with the policy pertaining to unique units between a major and minor, there are 3 options for the Chemistry minor. Please refer to the Academic Catalog for official requirements you must meet to qualify for a degree.
