The Interlibrary Loan (ILL) service offers students, faculty, and staff access to materials that are not currently held by Schroeder Library. The processing time usually takes between 5-10 days.

**For more information about ILL and our policies, please see our LibGuide.

How to place an Interlibrary Loan Request:

For books and articles:

Use OneSearch to determine if the Library already owns the book or article that you need.
Remember to put quotes around the title of the book or article. (Note: the screenshots show an example of a book search by title).

Next, click on the title of the book or article.

Click on the "Request Item through Interlibrary Loan" button.

Fill out the following fields: First Name, Last Name, E# (make sure you capitalize the “E”), CUI email address (please only use CUI email), and click Submit. (See LibGuide link above about requesting eBook chapters).

You will get a requestID when you submit the request. Save this for tracking purposes.

If you have any questions or need more information regarding this service, please call the library at 949-214-3090 or email librarian@cui.edu.

View the ILL Policy for more information and official policies on this service.
