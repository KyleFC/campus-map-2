Concordia Summer Piano Music Festival

Music Events

 

Experience CUI's 2023 Piano Festival!
Summer Piano Music Festival

The Concordia Summer Piano Music Fest is like a cool summer jam for piano-loving kids aged 11 and up. It's all about diving deep into piano music, going beyond the usual practice routine. We're talking about exploring musical vibes and elements that make piano playing a blast. This program isn't just about nailing down those technical piano moves. It's a full-on musical journey that covers all aspects of becoming a pro pianist. We want our young maestros to not only crush it on the keys but also get the bigger picture of what it means to be a musician. And hey, it's not your typical summer camp – it's a two-week adventure where these talented pianists get to soak in the joy of playing music. We're all about boosting that love for music and making performances.

Featured classes
Ancestors of Piano – Harpsichord and Organ:
Understanding the ancestors of the piano is like unlocking a musical time capsule. It gives you insight into the roots of the instrument, which is key to interpreting compositions from different eras.  Start with the harpsichord and clavichord – the piano's cool great-grandparents. These keyboards had their own unique sounds and playing styles. Understanding how musicians approached these instruments can shed light on early keyboard music.
Keyboard Improvisation (Jazz):
Let's dive into the world of jazz harmony! We love to spice things up with some sweet chords and progressions.  Let's cook up some tasty jazz harmony!
Dancing to Baroque Music Types:
This movement class will introduce students to ways that people across Europe danced to “Baroque” music types in the late 1600s and early 1700s.  Following a bodily warm-up each day, students will learn the basics of dancing to bourées, gavottes, menuets, and sarabandes, working sometimes with partners and sometimes in small groups. Dress in comfortable clothing that shows your feet, lower legs, and knees, and wear bare feet or socks (but no ballet slippers or street shoes.)  
Piano Technique:
How to use your body to play piano
Let’s play rhythms (Dalcroze Eurythmics):
You're not just sitting and playing notes; you're moving, grooving, and feeling the rhythm in your entire body. Dalcroze Eurhythmics, as it's called, is all about syncing your body movements with the music.
Handbell Ensemble:
Let's break that piano-playing solitude and bring in some ensemble vibes with handbells! Playing handbells with friends is like creating a magical symphony together. It's teamwork, and it's a ton of fun.
Seminar for the Featured composer:
Frederic Chopin
The Musician's Body – Maintenance for Peak Performance:
These informative, interactive workshops are designed to help musicians use our body and mind most effectively as we engage in musical activities, be they warming up, practicing, rehearsing, or performing.
