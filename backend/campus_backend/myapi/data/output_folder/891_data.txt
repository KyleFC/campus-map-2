Why Join an LLC?
Living in an LLC comes with great benefits!
There is no extra cost!
An opportunity to live and connect with students who share your interests, academic and personal goals
Have a ready-made support system of peers and staff who encourage you throughout your college journey
Faculty mentorship with professors dedicated to positively challenging you to expand your views through exploration and collaboration with inter-campus departments and academic programs
Belong and connect in a neighborhood residential experience
There is a lounge and courtyard designated to your specific community
Here's what your peers have to say!
LLCâ€™s are a place where anybody of any kind of background can come together and truly gain a community that no other residence hall can offer. These halls have amazing events that are geared toward learning more about yourself, each other, and the great God that we serve here at Concordia! So ask yourself, 'Wait...why am I not in an LLC?!
