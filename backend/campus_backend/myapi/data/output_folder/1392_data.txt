Welcome to the Department of Exercise and Sport Science

Students in Exercise and Sport Science study God's greatest creation, the human body and human movement. We find joy in understanding the gifts of movement, social interaction through sport, and the health and wellness developed through exercise and proper nutrition. We study the application of scientific principles and techniques with the purpose of improving and understanding sport, human movement, and the body's reaction to exercise, training and its environment.

Currently we offer two Exercise and Sport Science Majors

With further training we can pursue higher degrees in all the previously stated careers if we choose to advance the degree beyond the undergraduate level.
