Pre-Departure Orientations
STUDY ABROAD

All students studying abroad through the Moon International Center are required to attend at least one Pre-Departure Orientation during the semester prior to their term abroad.

In the Pre-Departure Orientations, you learn about:

Health and safety issues relevant to your study abroad program
General and country/region-specific cultural issues
Administrative details that must be completed prior to departure

During the country/region-specific cultural orientation, you will meet students who have studied abroad at your host institution or similar places and/or students who are from the country/region you will be visiting. Meeting the returned study abroad and international students is a great way to learn more about what you will experience.

Following acceptance to your program, the Moon International Center will provide you with dates and times for the Pre-departure Orientations.
