ENGR 101: Introduction to Engineering and Design
3

Develop creative thinking and problem solving skills essential to the engineer. Students are challenged to function as members of a team to communicate well. Broad exposure is provided to various engineering disciplines and practices.

ENGR 210: Entrepreneurial Engineering Economics
3

This course will introduce you to engineering economics, which is the application of economics and decision theory to the evaluation of engineering alternatives in planning, developing, constructing, and managing engineering projects.

ENGR 212: Project Management and Communication in Christian Context
3

Students will incorporate the unique incarnational aspects of Jesus Christ into the skills related to service, teamwork, project planning and management, and communication within a team and for stakeholders. Students work in teams to plan and carry out semester-long projects.

ENGR 312: Statics & Strength of Materials
4

Develop core competencies associated with mechanical, biomechanical, and structural engineering. Physics principles are used to determine internal and external forces in various types of members, including introduction to analysis software. The material's response to load - stress and strain - is also emphasized. Principles for design of simple mechanical and structural elements are introduced. Pre/Co-requisites: PHY 221

ENGR 314: Mechanical Dynamics
3

Students will learn the foundations of the kinematics of particles, systems of particles, and rigid bodies. Topics include impulse and momentum, conservation of energy, rotation, and vibrations. Computational problem solving skills will be developed to solve dynamic engineering problems. Pre/Co-requisites: ENGR 312

ENGR 316: Fluid Mechanics
3

Study of static and dynamic effects in Fluid Kinematics using Lagrangian and Eulerian analysis. Continuity, momentum, and energy equations in integral and differential form for incompressible flows. Introduction to boundary layer theory and transient fluid motion. Comparison of theory to experimental and computational fluid dynamic results. Pre/Co-requisites: MTH 384

ENGR 318: Heat & Mass Transport
3

This course introduces the governing principles behind heat and mass transport phenomena. Students will develop an understanding of steady state and transient conduction and diffusion, laminar and turbulent convective transport, and the computational solution strategies often employed by engineers. Pre/Co-requisite: MTH 384

PHY 315: Electronics I: Analog Circuits
3

This hands-on course will focus on the design, fabrication, and testing of analog electronic circuits, circuit components, and devices with special emphasis on the use of electronic test equipment. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Prerequisite: C- or better in PHY 221 or consent of instructor.

ENGR 320: Signals & Systems
3

This course presents students with the fundamentals of analog and digital signal processing in the context of engineering systems. Interpretation and analysis of continuous and discrete time signals are introduced, as well as the use of Fourier and Laplace transforms. Sampling, filtering, modulation, and feedback for systems are discussed using cases from diverse areas of engineering.

PHY 325: Scientific Equipment Design and Fabrication
3

This hands-on course will focus on the design of scientific equipment, the use of scientific glassblowing, and machine shop tools, particularly the lathe and the knee-type mill, to fabricate, repair, and modify scientific equipment; also included will be a comprehensive introduction to vacuum technology. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Prerequisite: C- or better in PHY 221 or consent of instructor.

ENGR 330: Computer Aided Design
3

Two- and three-dimensional computer aided design principles are developed through the use of a 3D solid modeling program. Students will design and create engineering drawings and geometric models. The course will culminate with a team-based project resulting in the design and fabrication of a prototype. Pre/Co-requisite: ENGR 101

ENGR 495: Senior Capstone I
2

Students engage the knowledge content of their academic discipline in the context of a specific technology problem or need and in collaboration with a partner organization or client community. Teams demonstrate effective project management strategies, report on progress consistently, and document significant design activity. Â Senior level status required

ENGR 496: Senior Capstone I
