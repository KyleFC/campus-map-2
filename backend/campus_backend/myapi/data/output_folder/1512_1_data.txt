 on campus, you will not need to enter a name and password in order to log in. From off campus, you will need to enter your Student ID and password. On the ezproxy page, type your Student ID in the E# field, and then type the same password that you use for your Eagles email and Blackboard into the password field.

What if you cannot log in?

If you are having problems logging in to the library databases, make sure you have activated your account on the self-service password management website. You will NOT be able to use your temporary password to log in to any Concordia online resource. You must activateÂ in the self-service site and change your password first. If you have already activated, go to the self-service password management website and try resetting your password using the instructions on the website.

If this still does not work contact IT Services via email: ITS@cui.edu or call 949.214.3175.
