“My time at the Servant Leadership Institute has positively impacted me personally and professionally. The topics were thought-provoking and engaging. I’m grateful to the entire Concordia University staff for their hospitality and kindness.”
Melissa - Cajon Valley Union School District

 

“The Servant Leadership Institute has been one of the best conferences I have attended.  There was so much thought and care that went into choosing speakers to share practical skills, practices, experiences, and research that applies to everyone in the field of education. There is something for everyone, no matter how much experience you have. It is so refreshing, and I left both sessions inspired, recharged, and wanting to share what I’ve learned.”
