Spirit Bells

Director, Erik Der

The handbell program at Concordia University is internationally respected for its high-quality and richly varied performances as well as breadth of opportunities for ringers and future directors, in three ensembles. A handbell quartet, private lessons and private coaching are also part of the program.

Spirit Bells is a select group which performs in the annual Concordia Christmas (a service for students, faculty, staff and families on campus), both Handbell Invitational Concerts, Young Ringers Festival and Spring Handbell Concert, campus Chapel services, Sunday outings, and concerts at area churches. They, along with Concert Handbells, have an annual Fall retreat and go on tour together. This ensemble is open by audition. Rehearsals are also on Monday and Wednesday, 4:45-6:15.

Past Summer Handbell Tours Include
2022: Denver
2019: Las Vegas
2018: Phoenix
2017: Delta-Bay Area and Dr. Herb Geisler's Retirement
2016: Alaska
