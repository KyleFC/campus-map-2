Prepare for a Career as an Actuary

The Actuarial Science Program is designed to assist students who have an interest in pursuing a career as an actuary with planning their coursework, arranging internships, and preparing for the Society of Actuaries preliminary examinations (Exam P: Probability and Exam FM: Financial Mathematics). The Society of Actuaries does not require a specific undergraduate major as a prerequisite for taking exams, but most encourage emphasis in the mathematics, finance and business coursework. Students who enter the Actuarial Science Program at Concordia University will take courses most appropriate for preparing for the first two exams as well as preparing for a career in actuarial science. Additional courses (including some which will be validated by educational experience by the SOA) and a major should be selected based on student interest and career goals.

Program Requirements
General Education (54-55 Units)
Normally completed during the first two (2) years of attendance.
Major Requirements
Completion of any approved major, typically a mathematics major with a selection of business and economics courses.
Program Requirements
Students should select courses from a variety of fields (including finance, economics and mathematics) that will best prepare them for their first Preliminary Examination (Exam P or Exam FM) by the Society of Actuaries toward the end of their sophomore or junior year.
