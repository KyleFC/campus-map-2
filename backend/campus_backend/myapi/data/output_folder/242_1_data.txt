Social Security Number Safety

A SSN is only meant to be used for tax and government purposes; however, it is often used by financial institutions, businesses, and others as a unique identification number. Because the SSN is a unique ID, it is often the target of "identity theft." You should be very careful about where and to whom you give your SSN. Never carry your Social Security card or number with you. Keep it at home in a secure place.

Only give your SSN to someone who has a specific and legitimate need for it.
Be very careful with any forms, applications, or other materials that may have your SSN on it.
Never give your SSN to someone who phones you.
Never reply to emails or websites that request a SSN.
