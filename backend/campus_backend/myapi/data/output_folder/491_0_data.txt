Curriculum

21st-century church musicians need an incredibly diverse skill-set, including the ability to work collaboratively with pastors, administer and recruit, lead a congregation in song, direct ensembles, and work with children. Concordia University Irvine has addressed this need for diversity by hiring full-time professors who are leading experts in each area, and providing students significant experience in all areas. This leads to graduates who are in demand for full-time church employment in many Christian denominations. Concordia is also proud to be one of the top schools in the nation for commissioning church musicians for the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod through our Director of Parish Music program.
