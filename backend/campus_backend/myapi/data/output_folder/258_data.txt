Yellow Ribbon Program
VETERANS RESOURCE CENTER

Concordia University Irvine is proud to participate in the Yellow Ribbon GI Education Enhancement Program and we have an unlimited number of scholarships at an unlimited dollar amount for those who qualify.

The Yellow Ribbon Program (YRP) provides financial assistance to eligible students for the difference between net tuition and fees and the amount of reimbursement approved by the VA ($27,120.05). Any tuition/mandatory fees remaining after the $27,120.05 is paid out will be split evenly between the VA and CUI. Concordia University Irvine is committed to honoring all students who receive 100% benefit level of the Chapter 33-Post 9/11 GI Bill®.
