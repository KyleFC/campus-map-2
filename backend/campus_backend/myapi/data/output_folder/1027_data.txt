Mission Statement

To promote esports, board games, and videogames as a hobby through competitive and enjoyable casual games. For friends and students to come together and play a variety of video games, regardless of skill level. The goal is to build friendship, promote good sportsmanship and teamwork, compete in tournaments representing Concordia University, and provide a place for members to relax, have fun, and get away from stress. All while maintaining Christian values (ex. Integrity, kindness, leadership, and compassion, humility, loyalty, faith, and moderation).
