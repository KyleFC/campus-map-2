CELEBRATION OF MINISTRY
Christ College
Celebration of Ministry

Concordia University Irvine’s Christ College, the school of theology and church vocations, invites you to their annual Celebration of Ministry. This service recognizes Concordia’s students and alumni who are in transitional points in their ministry preparation: those receiving first calls, internships, vicarages, student teaching assignments, and those continuing in their vocations as students. Students who will be graduating this spring will also be presented with medallions that are worn at graduation. All are welcome to thank God for raising up servants for his church.

2024 Celebration of Ministry - April 14 at 6:30pm in the CU Center
