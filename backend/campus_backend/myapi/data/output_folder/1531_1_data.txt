or the sport by going out and supporting it.”

Koester is excited about the growth he sees in Concordia’s future. He said being a DII school is the catalyst that can help Concordia University Irvine grow.

“It will definitely impact our campus with all the different things that come with NCAA,” Koester said.

“Our school is currently upgrading our basketball gym and that’s exciting,” he continued. “It might be a slow process, and I might not be at Concordia when it finishes because I graduate in the spring, but I’ll be able to come back and see what it grows into."

Koester said it is important to him to be able to say he was at Concordia at the beginning of the NCAA DII membership process.
