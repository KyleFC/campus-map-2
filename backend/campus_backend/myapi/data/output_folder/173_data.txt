Advancing accessibility for students with disabilities.

The mission of Disability Access Services (DAS) is to partner with the campus community in creating equitable access to eligible students while promoting disability-inclusive diversity. We address barriers in the learning, social, and physical environments of Concordia University Irvine through accommodations, education, consultation, and advocacy.

Appeal & Reporting Process

If a student has been denied an accommodation they requested and would like to appeal the denial, they should meet with the Director of Disability Access Services to discuss the appeal. The DAS Director will communicate a decision within 2 weeks.

If at any time a student feels that they have experienced discrimination or harassment as a result of their disability by any CUI staff, student, or faculty, the student should submit an Equity Grievance Complaint. These reports are evaluated by the Accommodation Review Committee, and members are appointed by the VP of Student Affairs. Please click the link below to submit a non-Title IX Grievance report.
