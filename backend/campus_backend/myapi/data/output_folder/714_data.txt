Traveling

You will spend a semester in Cambridge from around mid-September to the third week of December. Trips around England are offered in connection with certain courses. There is no mid-semester break, but you do have plenty of time to trek around the United Kingdom or Europe before the semester starts.

Housing

You will live with other students in Luther Hall near Westfield House.

Food

Luther Hall has two full kitchens where you can prepare your own meals. Grocery stores, a daily outdoor market, and a wealth of restaurants are within walking distance.

 
Study Together

Study together some of the world’s greatest works of literature and art in one of the world’s finest intellectual and cultural cities.

Campus

Classes are held in Westfield House, which has a library, lecture rooms and a common meeting area. Lectures by University of Cambridge professors are given in various colleges. You may use the University Library, too.

Faculty

Classes — taught in the Cambridge style of small seminar discussions, individual supervisions, and plenary lectures — are led by a visiting Concordia University, Irvine professor and professors from Westfield House. You can also attend lectures by highly-accomplished scholars at the University of Cambridge in connection with some of your classes.

Courses and Credits

Students can earn up to 15 units in this program. All courses count for Q&I (general education), major, minor, or elective requirements.

Typical offerings include Christianity and the Arts, Calculus I, British Science Fiction, Introduction to the Old Testament, New Testament Gospels, World Religions, Greek, The Continental Reformation, and Philosophy of Religion.

Students may, if approved, use 1 or 2 of their course options to enroll in a "Cambridge Experience" course. Courses are typically offered in subjects such as history, philosophy, politics, and sociology. Students taking a "Cambridge Experience" course attend lectures at Cambridge University and do the course's supervisions, seminars, and assessments with Westfield House.

Honors students can earn 6 Honors points for successfully completing the Concordia Cambridge Program.

 
Worship Together

Worship together at a center of the English Reformation and in its medieval chapels, churches, and cathedrals.

Chapel

Daily chapel is held each morning at Resurrection Lutheran Church next to Westfield House. Choral Evensong — a classic Cambridge chapel tradition—occurs every evening at several colleges, including King's College.
