Hispanic Leadership Conference
A college road map for community college & high school students

DATE TBD

2025

Spring 2025 date TBD

Join us for Concordia University Irvine’s 7th Hispanic Leadership Conference for community college and high school students.

Since 2016, this FREE event has been inspiring community college and high school students to pursue academic goals for a bright future. The purpose of this event is to help attendees navigate the path to college. Students will discover that college is not a dream, it’s a plan. The conference offers a toolkit of educational resources about college majors, financial aid, as well as inspiring first-generation speakers, industry professionals, and a keynote. Parents can also join their own breakout session—in Spanish/en español—that offers valuable resources on what to expect as their child begins their college journey. The conference ends with a free lunch and a college Information Fair.

Students

Whether you are currently enrolled at a California Community College looking to transfer to a four-year university, or a student in high school, this conference is for you and your parents! For questions, visit www.cui.edu/hispanic or contact hispanic@cui.edu.

Teachers, Counselors, Principals

This conference is a free opportunity for students to learn more about college access. Principals, teachers, and counselors may also join the free conference. Once registration opens, we ask that students register individually online with a valid email address in order to participate. Please do not register your students as one class or group with one email.
