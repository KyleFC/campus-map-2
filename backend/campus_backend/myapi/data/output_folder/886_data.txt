LIVING LEARNING COMMUNITIES
LLC Model

Concordia Universityâ€™s LLCs provide a holistic approach to student development and learning through academic partnerships, and service-learning opportunities. Each community is uniquely designed to facilitate meaningful connections between peers and among students, faculty, and staff. Students may seek to participate in one of the four common interest communities and one transition community. With five different communities, we seek to provide all of our students the opportunity to experience a seamless learning environment in our residential areas.

Common Interest Communities

These four communities (located in the Upper Quads) are not tied to a specific major but house students who are connected through common values and shared interests. Faculty and students engage in intentional conversation and experiences that align with each LLC mission.

Bella Amore

A community of women engaged in critical conversation about what is true, noble, right, pure and admirable.
