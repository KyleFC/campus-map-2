Private | Alternative Loans

Deferment or Forbearance opportunities vary from lender to lender. If you are having trouble making your monthly private student loan payments, contact your lender immediately and inquire if a deferment or forbearance is an option for you. DO NOT ignore your lender if they are trying to reach you. Be upfront with them about your situation so they can best assess what options you may be eligible for that can help you.

Loan Forgiveness

In certain situations, you can have your federal student loans forgiven, canceled, or discharged. Learn more about the types of forgiveness and whether you qualify due to your job or other circumstances by clicking here.

Fresh Start Initiative

On April 6, 2022, the U.S. Department of Education (ED) announced an initiative—called “Fresh Start”—to help eligible borrowers in default. Fresh Start is a one-time temporary program from the U.S. Department of Education that offers special benefits for borrowers with defaulted federal student loans.

If your defaulted loans are eligible, Fresh Start will provide you with several benefits, including access to federal student aid and credit reporting changes. You will also get the opportunity to get out of default and keep benefits long term. However, you need to act to claim the full benefits of Fresh Start and get out of default.

The Fresh Start period will end on August 31, 2024. After that date, you will not be able to claim these benefits.

For more information the Fresh Start Initiative click here or go to the Federal Student Aid website.
