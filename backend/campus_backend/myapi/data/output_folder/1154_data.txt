MUSIC SCHOLARSHIP INTEREST FORM

All students, regardless of major, who are interested in participating in music groups at Concordia University Irvine (CUI) should complete:

A music scholarship interest form (brief form explaining your background in music)
The online application for acceptance into CUI.

Once the music scholarship interest form is completed, students may arrange an on-campus audition by emailing auditions@cui.edu. Video auditions may also be submitted to this email address for review.

Music scholarship amounts will be determined as part of the overall financial aid package, which may include academic merit, need-based grants, and music scholarships. There is a significant financial advantage for students who qualify for music scholarships over those who do not. An audition is strongly suggested!

Auditions

Contact auditions@cui.edu to set up your audition.

Auditions may occur during any visit day sponsored by the Office of Admissions. Or, those visiting from out of town may schedule ad-hoc auditions to coincide with their visit. The music department finalizes some awards in December (in conjunction with applications that meet the December deadline), most awards in February (in conjunction with Fine Arts Day), and some additional awards on a rolling basis from March through the summertime. Concordia has recently experienced record numbers of auditions, so the earlier students audition, the better chance they have of maximizing their music scholarship offer.

If you are unable to visit campus, please send a video audition to auditions@cui.edu (most upload an audition to YouTube and send a link)
