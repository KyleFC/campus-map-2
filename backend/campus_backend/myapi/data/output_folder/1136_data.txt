Dear Friends,

It is with great pleasure and excitement that I invite you, as the President of Concordia University Irvine, to join Kim and me on a 12-day Concordia Choir “Companions Tour” of southern Spain and Portugal from May 9-20, 2023.

Enjoy three performances of the Concordia Choir in Seville (Spain) and Faro and Lisbon (Portugal). Additionally, you will have the opportunity to enjoy a meal with the Concordia singers at a small local restaurant during your free night in Granada.

During this tour of one of the most beautiful regions of Europe, we’ll explore Seville, the jewel of Spain, including visits to Plaza de España, the Giralda bell tower of the Seville Cathedral, Torre del Oro, and the breathtaking Royal Alcazar. In Granada, we’ll visit Alhambra, built in 889 AD and still standing as one of the finest monuments of Islamic architecture. We’ll cross into Portugal by traversing the Algarve Coast, featuring enchanting fishing villages, before entering Faro for a walking tour of the old city dating to the 13th century. We’ll finish the tour with a three-day visit to Lisbon, the capital of Portugal. Lisbon features world heritage sites such as St. George’s Castle, Jerónimos Monastery, and the Sanctuary of Fátima, a Catholic shrine where the Virgin Mary is said to have appeared.

Kim and I are excited to offer this companion tour which provides a balance between traveling with the Concordia choir and free time to explore and experience the delights of Spanish and Portuguese culture. We’ll travel in our own motor coach and stay in first class/select hotels (4-4.5 star) hotels. Also included are: roundtrip economy airline tickets from Los Angeles; daily breakfast; seven dinners; three Concordia Choir concerts; all scheduled sightseeing entrance fees; tips for Tour Manager, Bus Driver and Local Guides.

We look forward to having you join us on this amazing trip to southern Spain and Portugal. It promises to be a wonderful experience for all with time to enjoy the fellowship of old friends and new. Travel arrangements are provided by KI Concerts, a partner of the Concordia Music department.

NOW is the time to make plans and reserve your place on this tour, as space is limited. Don’t miss out on this opportunity to experience the history, culture, and remarkable scenery of the Iberian Peninsula!

We’re so excited for you to join us on this tour.

Pax Domini,

Dr. Michael & Mrs. Kimberly Thomas
President, Concordia University Irvine

Traveling with Dr. Thomas
What I consider most valuable in any trip abroad is the unedited, undigested, and unscripted nature of the information you receive. Having Dr. Thomas standing next to you only multiplies the fun.
