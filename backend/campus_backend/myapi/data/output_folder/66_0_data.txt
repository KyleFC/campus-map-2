Opportunities For English Majors

According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, “what sets two equally qualified job candidates apart can be as simple as who has the better communication skills.” English majors learn how to write, analyze material and communicate effectively. When not in the classroom, our University, and the Department of English, Writing and Modern Languages, afford you the chance to practice these skills outside the classroom.

Academic Opportunities

As an English major, you can combine your degree with a related minor, double major, or a pre-professional program; or transition directly into our MAEd program. Our English students can also choose to earn their CA credential while they earn their undergraduate degree.
