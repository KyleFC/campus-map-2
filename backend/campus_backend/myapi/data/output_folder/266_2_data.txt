he 90 and 70 semester units, only 30 non-accredited, credit by exam (AP, CLEP, DSST, IB (https://www.cui.edu/studentlife/registrar/index/id/21994/)), and/or military units may be transferred.
Military credits are accepted for elective credit only unless approval is obtained by the appropriate department chair or dean.
To receive credit for AP, CLEP, DSST, and IB, official scores must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar prior to the beginning of the student's final semester.
Within the 90 semester units, up to 15 units of P (Pass), S(Satisfactory), or CR (Credit) grades will be accepted and applied towards any degree requirement. The P, S, or CR grade must be equivalent to a C- or higher grade. Credit will not count in calculating a student's incoming, cumulative or institutional GPA at CUI.
An exception to this is that CUI will accept all courses that the transfer student took in Spring 2020 and Summer 2020 with P, S, or CR grade. These courses will count for any degree requirement as currently articulated.
