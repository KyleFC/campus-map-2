Welcome To The Alumni Association

The CUI Alumni Association (CUIAA) was established in 1984 to support graduates of Christ College Irvine & Concordia University Irvine, encouraging excellence in our alumni, engagement with our current students, and enhancing the communities we serve.

CUIAA Mission Statement

To encourage and promote alumni participation in the Concordia community through service and leadership, and to facilitate the lifelong role each has as stewards of Concordia University Irvine.

CUIAA Vision Statement

To facilitate a transformative impact on current & future alumni through the relational, educational, & spiritual bonds forged as students, rooted in the Great Commission of Jesus Christ, by empowering the Eagle Family to remain connected through influential events, networking opportunities, and the legacy of our Alma Mater.

CUIAA Membership

Membership in the Concordia University Irvine Alumni Association is free and automatic upon completion of any degree from Christ College Irvine and/or Concordia University Irvine. This membership provides you with the opportunity to serve on the Alumni Board of Directors and voting rights for topics and decisions that affect the entire association.
