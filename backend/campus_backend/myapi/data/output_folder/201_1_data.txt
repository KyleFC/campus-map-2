REVIEW THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF LOANS

What about debt from student loans?
Your earnings once you complete your college degree should exceed your debt.

According to the College Scorecard, once a student graduates with their Undergraduate degree, the typical monthly loan payment is $257/month. Take a look at the median debt versus the median income for graduates*.

*see the U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard
