ABSN Curriculum at Concordia

The Accelerated BSN program at Concordia University Irvine aims to equip future nurses with the knowledge and skills to succeed in their professional nursing careers. The curriculum for our accelerated BSN is rigorous and reflects current nursing practice and regulations.

The ABSN curriculum divides into four semesters, and during their nursing school journey, depending on which program option they choose, students experience three learning modalities.

Students enrolled in our campus-based ABSN program attend classes at our campus in Irvine, and complete clinical rotations in and around Orange and Los Angeles counties.

Students enrolled in our hybrid ABSN program complete online courses via an intuitive e-Learning platform as well as in-person skills and simulation labs at our program site location in Rancho Cucamonga, California, and on-site clinical rotations. At every step of the hybrid program, Accelerated BSN students receive top-quality instruction from Concordia’s esteemed nursing faculty.
