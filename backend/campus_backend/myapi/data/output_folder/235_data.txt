Concordia’s campus boasts state-of-the art facilities, from our theater and art studios to our high-tech labs and modern classrooms. Students will receive a worldclass education while exploring their diverse interests and engaging in clubs and activities that will help make their college experience memorable.

Location

Concordia is in the heart of Irvine in sunny Southern California. Experience the rich culture of Los Angeles and Orange County as you explore some of the world’s best museums, cultural sites, beaches, and other natural wonders (not to mention Disneyland and Hollywood are practically in our backyard!).

Safety

Irvine is one of the safest cities in the US and rated the number one city to live in (per FBI/OC Register). We also take campus safety very seriously and have dedicated campus security and support for our students.
