Upcoming Events


Here at Concordia we are attuning the human ear and heart to the God-given glory of music and facilitating a deep sense of musicianship.

You play an important role as alumni, parents, and friends, in discipling these future leaders to fulfill the great commission, serve the community, and impact the world for Christ. Join us at one of these events and connect with the great things God is doing here.

We are placing music, worship and theology at the heart of campus to create a place for study, creativity, reflection, adoration and passionate seeking with both head and heart.

- Rev. Dr. Steve Mueller '86, Dean of Christ College

This is more than a building project; it is a statement of who we are.
