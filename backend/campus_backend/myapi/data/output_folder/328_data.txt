PAUSE
Good Shepherd Chapel

The Good Shepherd Chapel, illuminated by a kaleidoscope of colors from the window of stained glass, is an intimate hilltop venue featuring city views and warm acoustics. The chapel is used regularly for worship, solo recitals, and chamber music and houses a two-manual Schlicker pipe organ. Students often catch Disneyland’s fireworks display from this vantage point.
