International Student Admissions Process and Requirements

Applying to an international university has unique processes and requirements. Weâ€™ve broken down the application steps for new students and transfer students below.

New International Students

A new international student is a current high school student who will be attending a college or university for the first time. Entering students may submit an application at any time after the completion of their junior year of high school. To apply to Concordia as a first-time international student, follow the steps below.

Application Steps

Note: Concordia grants college credit for Credit by Exam Scores. Students may transfer a maximum of 30 non-accredited credits by exam (AP, CLEP, DSST, or IB units).

Mail to:

Office of Undergraduate Admissions
Concordia University Irvine
1530 Concordia West
Irvine, CA 92612

The student must submit scores from one of the following standardized tests: SAT, ACT, TOEFL, IELTS. Scores must be sent directly from the testing institution to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Copies are considered unofficial documents.

Complete the Application
Submit Official College Transcripts
Submit a transcript from each secondary and post-secondary school attended, current through the time of application. High School transcripts will be considered official only when sent through the mail in a sealed envelope or hand-carried to Concordia University Irvine in a sealed envelope.
ALL non-US equivalent transcripts must arrive with a certified English evaluation and translation documenting your coursework, examinations taken, grades received, passing and maximum marks, and evidence of secondary school graduation. The student must have a minimum GPA of 2.8 on a 4.0 scale, or equivalent to that according to the grading system used by the country that a student is applying from.
(Please note that CUI does not have a translation or evaluation service, and students are required to submit records in English. If the school does not issue an English translation, or if the transcript is not calculated into the US GPA grading system, the student is responsible for getting an official translation done. Please contact IERF and ask for a Detail Report (also known as a course-by-course report)
Submit Official Test Scores
