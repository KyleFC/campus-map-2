Concordia’s Science Facilities are housed in Founders Hall. Students have the opportunity to assist with faculty-led research projects, along with their own lab work in our on-campus facilities that support work in fields from biochemistry and molecular biology to inorganic and physical chemistry. Our Marine Lab is home to over 50 species of temperate marine organisms ranging from jellyfish to sharks and is primarily operated by student volunteers.
