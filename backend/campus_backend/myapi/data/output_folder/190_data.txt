SCHOOL OF
ARTS AND SCIENCES
Our students investigate the rich knowledge of the past, apply it to the innovations of the present, and utilize it to solve the complex situations of the future.
Welcome

The School of Arts & Sciences fosters the virtues of curiosity, courage, and humility in our students, thereby preparing them for their vocations in service to others. This is accomplished within the Lutheran liberal arts tradition by engaging with many enduring questions while relying upon the truth found in Jesus Christ.
