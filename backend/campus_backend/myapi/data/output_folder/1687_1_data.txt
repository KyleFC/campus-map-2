“community of learning,” since coursework is completed primarily through reading articles in text heavy units and posting to discussion forums. Concordia University’s online education ascribes to a different model in which "real time," synchronous learning experiences comprise a certain percentage of every course, bringing you face-to-face with our outstanding faculty and nationally recognized programs.

MAIS students will enjoy blended learning with the experience of international travel in a region of their choice. The field work is a continuation of the students’ learning, providing a rich context for applying their academic knowledge, a social laboratory to conduct project observation and research, and a setting for establishing and deepening relationships with those residing in their chosen regional community.
