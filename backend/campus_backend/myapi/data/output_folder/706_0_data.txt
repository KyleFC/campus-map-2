Biography

Jasmine Anderson is excited and blessed to be serving as an instructor and Coordinator of Clinical Education for the Athletic Training Education Program at Concordia University Irvine.

Jasmine is an alumni of Concordia University, Irvine where she earned her bachelor’s degree in exercise sport science with an emphasis in athletic training. After graduation she worked as an athletic trainer with the football and baseball programs at Saddleback College, while she pursued her single subject California teaching credential. At the completion of her teaching credential program Jasmine began working as a science teacher and athletic trainer at JSerra Catholic High School in San Juan Capistrano, CA. Jasmine then went on to complete her master’s degree in education with an emphasis in curriculum, instruction, and assessment. Upon finishing her master’s degree, she then took a teaching and athletic training position at Crean Lutheran High School in Irvine, CA. During her nearly ten-year tenure at Crean Lutheran, Jasmine served as the head athletic trainer, a science teacher, the science department chair, a WASC leadership team member, the director of cohort programming, and the director of faculty.

Outside of her passion for teaching and educational experiences, Jasmine has had many opportunities to grow in her sports medicine profession. Prior to teaching, she worked in physical therapy for six years and completed an extensive summer medical rotation with a local orthopedic surgeon. At JSerra, she helped to further the development of the sports medicine program by adding more of an emphasis on the importance of rehabilitating injuries and educating athletes and coaches about preventative care. At Crean Lutheran, she developed the athletic training program from the ground up and an extensive concussion management program that has been recognized by many concussion experts in the area.

Jasmine is also a certified athletic trainer through the Board of Certification (BOC) and holds current memberships in good standing with the National Athletic Trainers’ Association (NATA), the Far West Athletic Trainers’ Association (FWATA), and the California Athletic Trainers’ Association (CATA).

When Jasmine is not on campus serving in one of her roles at Concordia, she is at home spending time with her family. She is married to a wonderful man, who is also an athletic trainer, and they have 6 children together. Their household is very busy as their kids range from the ages of 7 years old to 1 years old (the youngest 2 are twins), but they have a lot of fun together and could not be more blessed!
