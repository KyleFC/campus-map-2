Financial Aid

Financial aid is the monetary assistance program provided to students for educational costs in the form of scholarships, grants, awards, part-time employment, and/or loans. It includes federal, state aid, private or outside aid, and aid from Concordia University. This packaging approach may include assistance from two or more sources of financial aid. The universityâ€™s goal is to award all applicants the maximum scholarship, grant, and loan(s) for which they qualify, within the restrictions of federal and state guidelines and institutional policies.

How to Apply for Financial Aid

Step 1

If this is your first time applying for federal financial aid, create a FSA ID. The student, and one parent if a dependent student, need to create an FSA ID online. Your FSA ID remains the same from year to year, so keep it in a safe place and never share it with anyone.

Returning students will need to login to the Federal Student Aid website with their FSA ID and complete a FAFSA renewal application.

Step 2

Fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form to be considered for federal grants, work-study, and loans. Make sure to include Concordia's school code - 013885.

Please note the FAFSA is a free application. Click here for facts on Financial Aid Consultants and Scholarship Services.

Step 3

Read all communications received from the Financial Aid Office and provide any requested documentation at your earliest convenience. All communication is sent via email to your student email account (Eagles). Once you receive notification you have an Eagles email, please activate it immediately.

The Financial Aid Office recognizes that households can experience changes in income, other finances, or experience a special or unusual circumstance that are not adequately reflected on the student's FAFSA. If you believe you have a special or unusual circumstance to be considered, please visit our Professional Judgment page or contact your financial aid counselor to discuss your situation.
