Integrated Dissertation Track
DOCTOR OF EDUCATION (Ed.D.) IN LEADERSHIP

The integrated dissertation track is designed to immerse doctoral students in research from the beginning through completion of the program. Starting the dissertation process at the beginning of the program allows and encourages students to integrate—when appropriate—their coursework topics with dissertation seminar discussions, as they progress through the dissertation track process. The track consists of five distinctive phases: Search for Researchable Problems, Scholarly Writing and Research Methods, Comprehensive Dissertation Proposal, Dissertation Research, and Degree Completion. The table below compares our integrated dissertation track to traditional doctorate designs.
