National Conference Course Offerings

The MCAA program has been proud to offer elective courses at these national conferences.

MCAA Course: TBD

NIAAA 54th Annual National
Athletic Director Show
December 15 - 19th
Orlando, FL

MCAA 591: Athletic Director Institute

56th CSADA Annual Conference
April 11-14th, 2024
San Diego, CA

The conference course elective gives MCAA students an opportunity to attend a national conference for athletic professionals, complete corresponding coursework, and receive credit toward their Master's in Coaching and Athletics Administration degree from CUI. Students who register for these courses attend the conference and the designated workshops noted in the course syllabus, meet briefly with an instructor before and after the conference, and submit a final assignment online prior to the end of the term.

Please note that the conference registration is separate from the tuition rate of the course. Students will need to arrange for their own conference registration fees as well as any travel accommodations.
