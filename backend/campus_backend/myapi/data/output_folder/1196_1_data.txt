on (literally, a deep stirring of the bowels within him) moved him to serve others and do so with gusto. We might take the cue and do the same, even if that person interrupts our lives for a moment.

In that instant, we might ask, “What is my convenience worth?” If it does not cost more than the opportunity to show compassion to one of God’s children, we are compelled to stop and serve with zeal.

Purpose

Still, we cannot neglect the overarching purpose of our service in momentary vocations. While we do not need to engage the “Gospel-presentation-full-court-press” in every situation, we must be cognizant of the divine design of these moments.

For example, when serving a stemmer, or panhandler, we cannot think only of their immediate needs, but also about the systemic issues behind their lack. This may not only mean altering our actions in the moment (I sit down for a meal with someone who asks for money, instead of just giving them spare change), but also being galvanized beyond this one act of service to perhaps engage in greater advocacy and action on their behalf.

While we may not engage in every momentary vocation (after all, our primary vocations are calling too), I encourage us all (with presence, passion, and purpose) to lean into the divine promptings that are at work in little interruptions, inconveniences, and opportunities to bless our neighbor and give glory to God in momentary vocations.
