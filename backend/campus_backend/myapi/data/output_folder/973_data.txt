GRADUATE FINANCIAL AID
Loans

A loan is money you borrow and must repay with interest under varying terms and conditions.

If you decide to take out a loan, make sure you understand who is making (i.e. offering) the loan and the terms and conditions of the loan. Student loans can come from the federal government, from private sources such as a bank or financial institution, or from other organizations. Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options.

While it is important to be cautious of irresponsible borrowing, loans are considered an integral part of a student's Financial Aid package. Please carefully review the different types of loans available below and consider each one as a viable option for financing a college education.
