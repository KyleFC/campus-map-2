Out of State Grievances
OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR
Distance Learning Complaint Process for Out of State Students

Concordia University desires to resolve student grievances, complaints and concerns in an expeditious, fair and amicable manner. Students residing outside of the State of California while attending Concordia through electronically delivered classes who desire to resolve a grievance should contact the appropriate office (Bursar's Office, Financial Aid Office, Student Affairs, etc.) However, if an issue cannot be resolved internally, you may file a complaint with your State. The Student Grievance Contact Information for Individual States provides phone numbers, emails and/or links to state education agencies. Concordia University is accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC) (Western Association of Schools and Colleges)
