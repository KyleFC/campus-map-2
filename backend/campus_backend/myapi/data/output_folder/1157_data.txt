Our Story

Founded in 1976, Concordia University Irvine today is one of the region’s leading private nonprofit Christian Lutheran universities. Preparing students for their vocations - their calling in life - Concordia’s Lutheran heritage provides a thoughtful and caring Christian community that lives out the theology of “Grace alone. Faith alone.”

LORI C. SIEKMANN
Message from the Director

Our theatre program is committed to excellence onstage and backstage, as we prepare you for a life of productive work in the theatre. Concordia is big enough to challenge you as an artist and small enough to mentor you as you perform, design, and direct. Grounded firmly in our identity as a Christian university, we support you on your personal artistic and spiritual journey.

There's so much more to share, so feel free to visit!
