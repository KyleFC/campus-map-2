Teaching Junior High

If you want to be a middle school teacher there are two paths you can pursue in California. It depends on the subjects you want to teach.

Some middle school teachers teach a cluster of courses such as math, English, and social studies. This arrangement requires the teacher to hold a multiple subject credential. In this case, the best subject matter preparation for you would be to complete Concordia’s Liberal Studies Major.

Other middle school teachers teach a single subject like a high school teacher. If this is your goal you will pursue a single subject credential in your desired subject.

Credential coursework can be done as part of your undergraduate degree meaning you can finish your bachelor’s degree and credential at the same time. Some universities have this as a “blended” program. We think it is just good sense. It will take 4, 4.5, or 5 years depending on the pace you set for becoming a teacher.
