General Information
STUDY ABROAD

One of the roles of the Study Abroad Office is to provide information about options for studying or working abroad to students and the Concordia community. The mission of the office is to serve as a one-stop resource for finding overseas educational opportunities available through Concordia University and selected external organizations. We are available to advise you on opportunities that best meet your needs.

When studying abroad, the Study Abroad Office expects students to pursue academic work that complements their major or minor course of study, gain a deeper understanding of a particular culture by spending an extended period of time immersed in that culture and improve their foreign language skills.
