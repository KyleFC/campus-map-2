LIVING LEARNING COMMUNITIES
Polis Plaza

A community of students, rooted in CUI's Christ-centered mission to produce wise, honorable, and cultivated citizens. We come together to wrestle with the complexities of ethics, politics, faith, and pop-culture.

Faculty in Residence

After completing his Ph.D. in English from the University of Notre Dame, Bryan Santin joined Concordia University Irvine as a full-time faculty member in 2017. An Associate Professor of English and a concurrent instructor in the Dept. of History and Political Thought, he teaches courses in American literature, American history, and the Core Curriculum. Bryan's research specialty is twentieth and twenty-first century American literature and politics, especially in relation to race and ethnicity. He and his wife, Julianne, welcomed their first child, Fitz Santin, in 2020. "Mr. Fitz," as he is affectionately known on campus, is excited to be the unofficial mascot of the Polis Plaza LLC.
