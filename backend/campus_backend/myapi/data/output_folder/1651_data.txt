Communication Studies Department

The Communication Studies Department sees its mission as preparing students as leaders in their communities and careers by developing their understanding of communication theory and research methodologies, as well as their proficiency in oral, written and mediated communication. The department offers a varied curriculum that includes both the classical courses associated with the discipline and those that reflect contemporary developments in the field. Courses are designed to prepare students for communication-related professions in such fields as business, industry, public relations, mass media, pre-law, pre-seminary and education.

Understanding of multiple theoretical perspectives and diverse intellectual underpinnings in communication as reflected in its philosophy and/or history.
Competency in effective communication with diverse others.
Competency in presentation, preferably in more than one form.
Competency in analysis and interpretation of contemporary media.
