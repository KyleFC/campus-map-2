Enduring Questions and Ideas (Q&I) Core

Concordia's Q&I Core courses exercise you intellectually, ethically, and spiritually. In the Q&I Core you will explore the world, God, and who you are as you search for what is true, good, and beautiful with your classmates and professors. Through this exploration you will be encouraged to cultivate yourself as a citizen who serves society and the church with wisdom and honor.

All Q&I Core courses are rooted in the liberal arts. This means that instead of training for a particular profession in the Q&I Core, you will build a broad intellectual foundation that prepares you for life and your other courses at Concordia. Throughout the Q&I Core, you will be challenged and encouraged to exercise strong reading, listening, thinking, speaking, and writing habits. These habits are essential for you to excel in these courses; they will also help you excel in your major and your many vocations in society, work, church, and family.
