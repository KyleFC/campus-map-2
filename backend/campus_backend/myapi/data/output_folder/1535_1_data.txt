‌
Do I need to apply for the ARP (HEERF III) emergency grants?

A portion of the funds will be automatically distributed to those students identified as those with exceptional need in August based on a block funding distribution.

Once the initial block grant funds are distributed, the university will determine the methodology for distributing the remainder of the HEERF III student grants. More information regarding this process will be available shortly. In the meantime, we recommend student sign up for direct deposit to expedite the receipt of funds.

‌
Are international students eligible for ARP (HEERF III) grants?

Yes, under the ARP definition of “student,” all students enrolled on or after the date of the declaration of the national emergency due to the coronavirus (March 13, 2020) are eligible, including international students. Priority will be given to students with exceptional need.

‌
Are DACA or undocumented students eligible for ARP (HEERF III) grants?

Yes, under the ARP definition of “student,” all students enrolled on or after the date of the declaration of the national emergency due to the coronavirus (March 13, 2020) are eligible, including DACA recipients, other DREAMers, and similar undocumented students. Priority will be given to students with exceptional need.

‌
Are student enrolled in an exclusively online program eligible for ARP (HEERF III) grants?

ARP explicitly state that emergency financial aid grants to students may be provided to students exclusively enrolled in distance education provided the institution prioritizes exceptional need.

‌
How much emergency grant can I expect to receive?

An initial block grant will be distributed to students with Pell eligibility in August. The amount for these grants has not been determined.

For all other emergency grants awarded, CUI will give priority to students with exceptional need on a case-by-case basis.

‌
How will students receive funds?

Eligible students will receive the funds either by direct deposit to the bank account on file or by check. The payment will be sent in the same manner as the student currently receives payments from CUI currently (i.e. payroll, reimbursement or refunds). 

Please be aware that the USPS is experiencing many challenges at this time and mail delivery can be slower than usual.

‌
Are there enrollment requirements?

Yes. You must have been enrolled as a student during the COVID-19 national emergency to be eligible for emergency financial aid grants from the HEERF, regardless of completion of a FAFSA or are eligibility for Title IV.

‌
Will emergency cash grants be applied to my current fall 2021 bill?

While CUI is not allowed to automatically apply the emergency grant to the student account, the student can use the funds to pay tuition in this semester if they have an outstanding balance. If the student does not currently have an outstanding tuition balance, the grant can also be used to pay tuition in future semesters.

‌
Do students have to repay ARP (HEERF III) emergency grants?

No. Emergency grants are a grant from the federal government. It is not a student loan and does not have to be repaid.

‌
Will ARP (HEERF III) funds be taxable income for students?

No. Similarly to the CARES Act and CRSAA emergency grants, these emergency funds provided to students will not be considered as taxable income. As stated by the IRS pertaining to the CARES Act: "Emergency financial aid grants under the CARES Act for unexpected expenses, unmet financial need, or expenses related to the disruption of campus operations on account of the COVID-19 pandemic … are qualified disaster relief payments under section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code. This grant is not includible in your gross income".

In an effort to distribute funds quickly to the students with exceptional need, block funding will be used for the distribution of HEERF III grants. To determine which students receive initial, block emergency grants and how much they would receive under Section 314(a)(1) or ARP, Concordia University Irvine will create a distribution formula for Pell Grant eligible students enrolled on or after March 13, 2021.
