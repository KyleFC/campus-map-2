Curriculum
MASTER OF ARTS IN EDUCATION: EDUCATIONAL ADMINISTRATION
Curriculum/Course Descriptions
Administrative Services Credential Requirements

Completion of 30 units of coursework for degree.

Transfer of Credits

The Preliminary Administrative Services Credential Program is a standards-based program rather than a course-based program. Because the state standards are spread throughout all courses of the Educational Administration program, transferring credits is very difficult because a candidate may have taken a course with a similar description but which lacks specific state standards. As such, transfer credits cannot be accepted into the Administration program.
