Life at Concordia

Join a community where you’re free to explore your interests and pursuits, make relationships that last a lifetime, and develop your own relationship with God. Your college experience is about learning, growing, and discovering who you are. What will you explore?

“Concordia’s community is so unique because we truly are a family. Everyone is so welcoming from the start, regardless of where you come from or who you are.”

Delainie D., ’24

Your Home Away from Home

At the heart of residential life at Concordia is a community that is dedicated to connecting and being of service to others. When you live in one of our Living Learning Communities, you will get to know a faculty member who lives in residence and gain a new perspective on what defines family.
