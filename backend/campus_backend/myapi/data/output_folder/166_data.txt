Concordia University System

Concordia University-Irvine is a member of the Concordia University System (CUS), which is comprised of nine colleges and universities affiliated with The Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod. Located across the United States, the colleges and universities offer over 160 undergraduate and 50 graduate programs. While each institution is unique, all nine campuses approach learning from a Lutheran context. The common goal is to develop Christian leaders for the church, community and world.
