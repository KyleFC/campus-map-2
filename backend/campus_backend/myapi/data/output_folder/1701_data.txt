Capstone Project

The MAIS program capstone project intends for students to apply theory and principles in a situation that approximates some aspect of a professional practice in a global/multicultural environment. The main components of the project come from the signature assignments of the various courses in the program. The completed project needs to be reviewed and approved by the Capstone advisor and the course instructor.

Students will begin their Capstone as soon as they successfully complete the core MAIS courses. A total of two consecutive terms are allowed for the Capstone project. Students will be assigned a Concordia University Irvine-approved faculty advisor or mentor to complete this project. Students will be awarded their masterâ€™s diploma when they have successfully completed both the core courses and the Capstone project.
