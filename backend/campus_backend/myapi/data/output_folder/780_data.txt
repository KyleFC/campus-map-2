Megan's Law
CAMPUS SAFETY

The Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act (CSCPA) of 2000 requires all institutions of higher education to provide the campus community with information on where students and faculty may obtain information about registered sex offenders.  In addition, both CSCPA and state law (California Penal Code 290.09) require convicted sex offenders who are enrolled or employed at institutions of higher education to register their status in the state and give notice to each institution in which they are enrolled or employed. Given that the Department of Campus Safety is not a sworn law enforcement agency, sex offenders must register at the Irvine Police Department.    

Megan's Law allows the public to access the registry. It also authorizes local law enforcement the right to notify the public about high-risk and serious sex offenders who reside in, are employed in, or frequent the community. Public information regarding registered sex offenders in California may be obtained by viewing the Megan's Law website.
