What Do You Like About Your Major?

As businesses continue to evolve, the need for accurate accounting for these economic changes becomes essential for businesses to succeed. Accountants are the scorekeepers who will measure, observe, and report on the economic aspects of an organization, government, or individual. The accounting discipline studies the decision-making process and theories behind creating and explaining such financial statements.

The accounting emphasis will provide you with the skills needed to maintain records that become the basis of financial reports. You will learn to describe how the financial structure and strength of an organization have changed over time, and with that knowledge be able to evaluate the economic status and viability of an organization.

With a degree in Business Administration: Accounting, you will be provided with the skills necessary to work in a variety of careers, such as:
