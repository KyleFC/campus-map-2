Clearlight – Concordia’s Yearbook
Mission Statement

The Clearlight is the student yearbook of Concordia University. The yearbook is published in April and is available for pick up the last week of classes in the spring semester. Through the use of journalistic, technologic, and life/workplace skills, students develop as critical thinkers and communicators. Each year, the editor and the staff work to produce a book that tells a story in a unified and compelling way.
