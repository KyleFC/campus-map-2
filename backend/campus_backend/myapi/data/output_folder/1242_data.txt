TITLE IX
Privacy & Confidentiality (Students)

The University is committed to protecting the privacy of all individuals involved in a report of sexual misconduct or relationship violence. In any report made under the policies, the privacy interest of those involved will be protected in a manner consistent with the need to respond to and to conduct a thorough review of the incident reported. Information will only be shared with those individuals who have a legitimate need to know the information in order to assist in the response to, investigation, and/or resolution of the complaint.

Confidentiality is not the same as privacy. Confidentiality means that the information shared with a certain University employee or outside professional cannot be disclosed to others without the express permission of the individual who shares the information.

To file a complaint with the University, please complete our online form, which will be submitted electronically to the Title IX Coordinator.
