ABOUT PRESIDENT MICHAEL A. THOMAS, PH.D.
Office of the President
Read "Journey to the Presidency"

Prior to coming to Concordia University Irvine, Dr. Thomas served as the Executive Director of the Lutheran Institute for Theology and Culture at Concordia University Portland (CUP). The Institute combines three academic departments (Religion, Music, and Art) with Campus Ministry, Church Relations, and the Center for Applied Lutheran Leadership. Previously, Dr. Thomas served as Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and Director of the Honors Program at CUP. As Professor of Religion, his academic interests include the history and literature of early Christianity, early Judaism, and the classical world. His true academic passion, however, was teaching the introductory religion course to first-year students at his own alma mater. Michael A. Thomas earned his B.A. at Concordia University Portland in 1993, his M.A. at the University of Washington in 1996 and his Ph.D. at the University of Virginia in 2008. View Curriculum Vitae
