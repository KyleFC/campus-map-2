Love Bears All Things
Read Devotion
Reflecting & Preparing

Grace and peace to you.

Lent is a time of reflection and preparation. A time when we are confronted with our need for a savior and a time to consider what our Savior has done for us.

This devotional is centered on the teaching in 1 Corinthians 13:7 – Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. It is our theme verse for the year at Concordia. It has been a lens that we have looked through as we have been walking together on campus. It is the starting point of each of our daily devotions this Lenten season as we reflect and prepare together.

We have asked members of the “CUI Family” to walk with us, as we watch Jesus walk to Easter. 41 faculty, staff, alumni, parents, and others have brought us daily devotions. Devotions that show us how the author sees love bearing all things during the season of Lent.

These voices represent a broad swath of the church. Each one bringing a unique view to their writing.

A new devotion will be released every day, starting on Ash Wednesday and ending on Easter. (We will not have devotions on Sundays during Lent.)

I pray that you will use this devotional guide to help you reflect and to draw nearer to God during this season when so many distractions vie for our attention. I pray that through these devotions you may find new ways to understand how love can bear, believe, hope, and endure all things.

If you would like to receive email reminders as these daily devotions are posted, you can subscribe to our email list that is dedicated solely to these Lenten devotions.

In Christ,
