BIO 111: General Biology I
4

This general biology course will examine major principles in biology at the molecular, cellular, and organism levels. Topics include cellular structure, metabolism processes, genetics, DNA function and genome expression, the origin of life and evolutionary principles, biotechnology, and molecular biology. The course emphasizes laboratory techniques, scientific writing, and the application of biological principles toward interpretation of case studies. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Typically offered each semester.

CHE 221: Chemistry I
4

A systematic exploration of fundamental chemical principles including matter, energy, electromagnetic radiation, atomic structure, periodicity, stoichiometry, chemical bonding, and structure will be examined in this course, including the introduction to the scientific method and epistemology in the context of the interface between the Christian faith and the chemical sciences. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Prerequisite: C- or better in CHE 101, or a passing score on the Chemistry Placement Exam, or consent of department chair.


CHE 222: Chemistry II
4

The major topics of this course will include solubility products, chemical thermodynamics, chemical kinetics, and qualitative analysis. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Prerequisite: C- or better in CHE 221.


PHY 211: Physics I
4

This introductory course will emphasize classical mechanics, wave motion, and thermodynamics. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Prerequisite: Consent of division chair.


OR

PHY 221: Calculus-based Physics I
4

This course will study Newtonian mechanics: vectors and scalars, kinematics and dynamics of translational and rotational motion, Newton's laws, speed, velocity, acceleration, force, torque, work, energy, linear and angular momentum, wave and harmonic motion, gravitation, friction, conservation of energy and momentum, thermodynamics. A lab fee is required. Prerequisite: MTH 271 (concurrent enrollment allowed) or consent of instructor.


PHY 212: Physics II
4

As a continuation of PHY 211, this course will emphasize electricity, magnetism, light, optics, and modern physics. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Prerequisite: C- or better in PHY 211.


OR

PHY 222: Calculus-based Physics II
4

As a continuation of PHY 221, this course will cover thermodynamics, Maxwell's equations of electricity and magnetism, current, voltage, resistance, inductance, reactance, power, optics and optical systems, interference, diffraction, polarization, dispersion, and coherence. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Prerequisites: C- or better in PHY 221 and MTH 272 (concurrent enrollment allowed) or consent of instructor.


CHE 321: Organic Chemistry I
4

This course will examine the fundamental concepts relating to organic compounds with an emphasis on structure, nomenclature, theory, bonding, stereochemistry, reaction mechanisms, and physical and chemical properties of the principle classes of compounds. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Prerequisite: C- or better in CHE 222.


CHE 322: Organic Chemistry II
4

This course will focus on aromaticity, advanced synthesis and reaction mechanisms, kinetics, organometallic chemistry, and bio-organic chemistry. A lab fee is required. Prerequisite: C- or better in CHE 321.


BIO 350: Molecular and Cellular Biology
4

A study of plant and animal molecular and cellular structures, biochemistry, and function is included in this course with an emphasis on the molecular level of cells, cellular metabolism, and the structure and function of the major organelles. Lab time is included in the schedule. A lab fee is required. Prerequisites: C- or better in (BIO 111, BIO 112, CHE 221) and (CHE 222 or SCI 115; or concurrent enrollment) or consent of instructor. Typically offered annually (fall semester).

BIO 355: Biostatistics
3

This course will introduce statistical analysis concepts and methods necessary for the interpretation of biological data in including a hands-on experience with computational methods and biological interpretation rather than statistical theory. Computer lab time is included in the schedule. Prerequisite: C- or better in BIO 111 or consent of instructor. Typically offered annually (fall semester).

CHE 403: Biological Inorganic Chemistry
3

This course will investigate the roles of metals in biology. Topics
