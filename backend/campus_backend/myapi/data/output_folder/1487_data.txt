The Worship Arts Leader Initiative
What is WALi?

The Worship Arts Leader initiative (WALi) is a community-building initiative of Concordia University Irvine’s Center for Worship Leadership (CWL). Special WALi gatherings are created by the CWL to intentionally connect leaders of worship together for common support, empowered learning, and professional inspiration. These gatherings intentionally center around various types/modes of training. Below are descriptions of some of the training opportunities we currently offer.

WALi Summit

The Summit is a national conference created to promote connectivity with one another for shared learning, common support, and professional inspiration. It is intentionally designed to address the needs of worship arts ministry staff, volunteer leaders, team members, pastors and students preparing for church worker vocations. Join us October 1-3, 2024 at Risen Savior in Chandler, AZ for the 2024 WALi Summit.
