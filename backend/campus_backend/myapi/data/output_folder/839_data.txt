ACADEMIC COACHING

The Peer Tutoring Program offers free peer tutoring services open to Concordia University, Irvine undergraduate students enrolled in courses where they are seeking academic assistance.

The program partners with faculty to recruit and hire qualified undergraduate students to become peer tutors. Academic Coaches can only tutor courses they have taken at Concordia and received an A or a B as the final grade.

Students in need of tutoring assistance can book one-on-one or small group tutoring appointments via WCOnline. Peer tutoring begins the second week of classes.
