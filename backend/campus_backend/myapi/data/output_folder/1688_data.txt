SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY
Policy Statement
All officially-recognized CUI social media accounts must be reviewed and approved by the Marketing Department
 
Each social media account must have responsible administrators assigned and be linked to appropriate CUI email accounts. Each administrator must meet with the Social Media Manager for training.
 
Each officially approved account must include a disclaimer statement (or link to the statement), in the prescribed form, regarding content and opinions contained on the site. SEE COMMENTS GUIDELINES
 
Inappropriate, offensive, injurious, illegal and content protected by FERPA may be removed by CUI employees identified as account administrators or at the direction of the Social Media Policy staff.
 
In an event of a campus or PR crisis, officially-recognized CUI social media accounts will refer all posts and comments to the main Concordia University Irvine social media sites
( Facebook and
Twitter)


The Concordia University Irvine Social Media Policy, Playbook and Best Practices for social media accounts will be followed.
