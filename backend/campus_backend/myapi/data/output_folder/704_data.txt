Student BOC Pass Rate

Once a BOC ID is matched to each student in a cohort, and the student has taken the BOC exam, this table will populate from data directly from the BOC. The aggregate pass rate is calculated by the number of graduates taking the exam divided by the number of graduates who pass the exam. Important note: The first time pass rate and total pass rate may be different than what was previously received by programs from the BOC in the Institution Pass Report. The BOC pass rate on previous reports from the BOC was calculated without regard to student cohort and was based on the BOC exam year (April-February of each year). BOC pass rate data posted on the program's website must match the data on this table.

Programs must meet or exceed a three year aggregate of 70 percent first-time pass rate on the BOC exam.
