Serving

Concordia University, as the Great Commission University, focuses on teaching students service through experiential learning. Many classes integrate service-learning through community service opportunities both locally and globally. Students can also serve through Global and Local Missions to improve the lives of those around them. Concordia's clubs and organizations perform community service projects at least once a semester. Various leadership groups also orient their programs around serving others, fundraising for non-profit organizations, and learning what it means to be Christ in the world.

Here are a few of our programs that offer service-learning:
