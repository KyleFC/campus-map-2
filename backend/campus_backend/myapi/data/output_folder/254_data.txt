Concordia University Academic Scholarships for New Students

To qualify for a Concordia University institutional scholarship opportunity, a student must maintain full-time undergraduate status for the entire academic year. A student must maintain the required GPA (see Additional Notes for each scholarship below) at the end of each semester for the academic scholarship to be renewed. Concordia University's institutional aid must go towards institutional charges, such as tuition, fees, university housing, and meal plans. It does not cover university class fees, fines, etc. Academic and Athletic Scholarships and Department Awards, including need-based aid, are known as Concordia institutional aid.
