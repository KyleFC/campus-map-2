Information for students interested in pursuing a career in the medical professions:

Prerequisites for graduate studies in the medical professions differ by the discipline (e.g. M.D., D.O., D.D.S., R.N., D.P.T., etc.) as well as by the school. The Biology Department at Concordia University Irvine can direct students to the proper coursework needed to help them achieve their professional goals. Students interested in a medical profession should make an appointment with Medical Science Program Director, Prof. Scott Gaines (NOTE: A Biology degree is NOT required to apply to medical science professional schools and students from other majors are encouraged to meet with Prof. Gaines to discuss graduate opportunities in the medical sciences).
