‌
How will students receive funds?

CUI students will receive the funds either by direct deposit to the bank account on file or by check. The payment will be sent in the same manner as the student currently receives payments from CUI currently (i.e. payroll, reimbursement or refunds).

Yes. You must have been registered for spring 2021 or the MCAA winter term to be considered eligible for a CRRSAA emergency grant.

‌
Will emergency cash grants be applied to my current Spring 2021 bill?

While CUI is not allowed to automatically apply the emergency grant to the student account, the student can use the funds to pay tuition in this semester if they have an outstanding balance. If the student does not currently have an outstanding tuition balance, the grant can also be used to pay tuition in future semesters.

‌
Do students have to repay HEERF II emergency grants?

No. Emergency grants are a grant from the federal government. It is not a student loan and does not have to be repaid.

‌
Will CRSAA funds be taxable income for students?

No. Similarly to the CARES Act emergency grants, these emergency funds provided to students will not be considered as taxable income. As stated by the IRS pertaining to the CARES Act: "Emergency financial aid grants under the CARES Act for unexpected expenses, unmet financial need, or expenses related to the disruption of campus operations on account of the COVID-19 pandemic … are qualified disaster relief payments under section 139 of the Internal Revenue Code. This grant is not includible in your gross income".

Funding & Expenditure Reporting

Under the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 (CRRSAA), Concordia University Irvine received (or anticipates receiving) $2,726,592 in funding through the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund Phase II (HEERF II), and has signed and returned the required acknowledgement committing to provide no less than $861,799  of the funding in emergency grants directly to students whose lives and education have been disrupted by the coronavirus outbreak.

To determine which students receive emergency grants and how much they would receive under Section 314(a)(1) of CRRSAA, Concordia University Irvine created a distribution formula for Title IV eligible (federal aid) students that incorporates Department of Education guidelines, Pell Grant eligibility, and enrollment in the spring 2020 semester. Priority will be given to student with exceptional need, both in selection order and in the size of the grant. Exceptional need will be determined using the following Formula: Cost of Attendance minus Expected Family Contribution (EFC) minus Total Gift Aid from all sources = remaining need. Groupings of students will be created based on remaining need. 

FAFSA results are the primary way to identify needy students as outlined in the formula above. 

Block funding will be used for the distribution of HEERF II grants ranging from $100 to $1,500.  Approximately 3,600 students are eligible to receive emergency grants, which may be used for any component of the student’s cost of attendance or for emergency costs that arise due to coronavirus, such as tuition, food, housing, health care (including mental health
