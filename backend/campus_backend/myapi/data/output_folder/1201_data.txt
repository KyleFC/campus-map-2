CAMPUS MINISTRY
Witness Program

Our Witness Program focuses on sharing the faith with students on and off campus. Some of our Witness Events include:

ten28 -- This special outreach chapel takes place 3 times per semester. We use secular music, video clips, drama, and Christian rock to help share God's Word. Christians are encouraged to invite friends who need to get to know Christ.

International Student Bible Studies -- Want to interact with students from different countries? It's a great way to help them with their English, and to share your faith with them. They are curious and open -- will you share with them?
