Overall Concerns About a Student’s Well-Being: behaviors that are outside of his/her typical patterns (i.e., student seems disengaged, no longer socializes with friend groups, never leaves their room).

ACC will respond as soon as possible to reports; however, the committee may not able to provide an immediate response to a concern. Call 911 or Campus Security if you feel threatened or an immediate response is needed.
