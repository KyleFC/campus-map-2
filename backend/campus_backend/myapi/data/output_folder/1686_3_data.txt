a, a former assistant women’s swimming and diving coach at CUI, the program offered a way for her to achieve her goal of obtaining a master’s degree without feeling rushed. “The online aspect of it gave me the most flexibility to juggle working full-time, raising my daughter, and educating myself for a master's degree,” says Staciana.

Adds Staciana, “I loved the program because the professors engaged with the students. I also loved that I could choose electives that most interested me and apply it to my job daily.”

“I think the program is really well-suited to provide a message that I believe in, that I believe to be true of what great coaches and administrators look like to a broader marketplace of coaches,” says Gabe. “Whoever designed the program and implemented the messaging points, was really good. They’ve spoken a lot of the same truths that I’ve seen to be true already in my career, having been exposed to great coaches.”

“I compared some other programs and nothing quite fit the curriculum like Concordia," says Michelle, who ran the softball program at the University of Illinois at Chicago for eight years, before taking on her current role as head softball coach at Washington University in St. Louis. “I loved the Women in Sports class. It shows the history of how I have the ability to be head coach today and make a living doing that,” says Michelle. “The program is exactly what I want for being a coach and hopefully teacher-administrator.”
