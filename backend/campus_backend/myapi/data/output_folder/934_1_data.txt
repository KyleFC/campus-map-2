be in great hands, with teachers like Catherine.”

“Sandy won’t see the benefits of this, but she told me she wouldn’t have done the proposal if she didn’t see something in me and think I could help carry this program into the future,” Standridge says.

Standridge is the first student-teacher the veteran educator has hired in 37 years.

The ultimate impact is on students who “are doing awesome,” says Standridge. “Every day after classes the kids thank me and say, ‘This is so much fun. This is the best thing that happened to me, and I love playing music.’ They’re in the very beginning stages of playing, but they’re getting there.”

Students may even take their instruments home to practice and bring them to school twice a week.

Standridge had a great experience at CUI, she says. She went on the first Around-the-World Semester® and found it “completely life-changing,” she says. She fell in love with many of the countries—and with Erik Olsen ’12, whom she will marry next spring.

Standridge credits CUI professor Herb Geisler with setting her on her present path.

“He’s the one that placed me in the school I work at now, so I pretty much owe everything to him,” she says. “Going to Concordia was totally God. I had my mind set on something else and when it came time to choose I just said, ‘I’m going to Concordia.’ It was exactly where I needed to be and God knew that. I always have felt that God has led me wherever I need to go.”
