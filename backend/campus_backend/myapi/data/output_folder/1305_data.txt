$100,000,000 RAISED!

Forward in Faith - The Campaign for Concordia came to an historic close on December 31, 2020. The Concordia Family thanks you – and most importantly, the Lord – for the abundant blessings that have been shared with Concordia's students. Over 10,000 donors participated in the Campaign and propelled us well over the $85M campaign goal. To God be the Glory!

Annual Fund Gifts Secure the Concordia Experience

Your Annual Fund donations gave Concordia the flexibility to direct them where it was needed most – COVID response, student aid, technology, lab equipment, research opportunities and much more! Your gifts helped ensure CUI could meet a student’s financial needs through scholarships, giving as many students the Concordia Experience as possible.

We are thankful for the many generous people who support student aid. Thank you for being a blessing to us so we can serve in the future.
