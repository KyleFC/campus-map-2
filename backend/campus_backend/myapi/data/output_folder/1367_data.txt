TROY MAKALENA
Business Administration Major: Sport Management
Graphic Design Minor

What do you hope to do with the skills you've gained at Concordia University IrvineÂ after graduation?

Following my time at CUI, I hope to pursue my love for graphic design and social media in the sports industry. My dream job is to be a lead graphic designer at a Division I university athletic department and down the line teach a graphic design class specifically for sports design.

What programs or activities are you involved with at Concordia University Irvine?

For the last three years I have been the sports photographer and graphic designer for the athletic department here at CUI.
