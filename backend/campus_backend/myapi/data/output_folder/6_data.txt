Concordia is committed to making higher education affordable. We offer merit- and need-based scholarships, as well as music and athletic scholarships, and we award more than $58 million in federal, state, and institutional assistance each year. In fact, all of our students receive some form of financial aid. What’s more, it’s possible — and completely normal — to graduate in four years from Concordia. This translates into significant savings and stronger financial health as you start the next chapter of your life.
