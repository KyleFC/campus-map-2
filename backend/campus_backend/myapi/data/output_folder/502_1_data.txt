asses and the campus culture, Shabalala had found a second home.

When you are at Concordia, you are not just a face," Shabalala said. "I had professors who dedicated their time for me ... helping me to be the best writer, helping me to construct my thoughts, and even inspiring me to look at grad school ... They inspired me to love education.

Her love of education continued after she graduated from CUI in May 2016 with a bachelor's degree in communication studies and a minor in theology. With the help of her mentor, English Professor Adam Lee, Shabalala secured a teaching post at a public middle school in Shenzhen, China. There, she taught German and English, often drawing on the knowledge she gained from her CUI communication classes.

"Because of that background, the communication background that I came with, (I was) able to go to my colleagues and even my students and say, there's an issue and it needs to be addressed and we address the issue right there and then and then we move forward with no baggage," she said.

Shabalala completed her first academic year as a teacher on June 23 and is embarking on a new journey to acquire her master's degree in Spiritual Care at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis. After that, she would like to work with former child soldiers and victims of civil war in Central Africa.

"I feel like I'm bringing all this global knowledge that will strengthen my people, my community," Shabalala said. "It's just an amazing gift."
