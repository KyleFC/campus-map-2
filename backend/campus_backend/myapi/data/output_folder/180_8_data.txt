ps. This course fulfills Q&I general education. Offered alternate years (odd years, fall semester).
Who Am I and Who Are They?

The exploration of this question analyzes the complex, dynamic interplay between self and other. Living in a good society requires citizens to be “wise, honorable, and cultivated” by closely examining how individuals think about, construct, act upon, and relate to one another. Courses that explore this question concentrate on the dialectic between “self” and “other” underscoring the various historical, economic, political, cultural, and social forces that shape both “I” and “they,” as well as the tensions that exist between the two.
