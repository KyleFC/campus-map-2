What is New Student Orientation?

New Student Orientation is designed to help new students transition smoothly here at Concordia University, Irvine. Connecting with the student body, learning about the campus culture, and acclimating to a new living situation are all experiences which new freshman and transfer students will have during orientation. With the help of the Peer Advising Leaders (PALs), Resident Assistants (RAs) and other support staff from various departments on campus, the events and activities make a great first impression that will stay with new students throughout their time at Concordia. Concordia offers three orientation events - fall, spring, and summer. Here at Concordia, we call our Fall New Student Orientation, WOW: Week of Welcome.

‌
What is Week of Welcome (WOW)?

Week of Welcome is our fall orientation experience for new students and their families. It kicks off on Friday, August 16th and goes through the first week of school. Events during WOW are designed to help new students meet their peers, learn about key campus resources, and prepare new students for their experience at Concordia University Irvine. Parents and families are welcome to attend events on Friday, August 16th and Saturday, August 17th. You can expect to have a lot of fun at events such as, Late Nite, Throwdown, The Hunt Field Day, the Involvement Fair, Beach Bash, SHOUT!, and More!

‌
When should I arrive for WOW?

New students will receive their check-in time to their eagles email prior to WOW. For the best possible experience, please only arrive at your assigned check-in time. You will be directed to the drive through check in at the East Lot. Resident students will then proceed to their housing assignment and commuter students will be directed to the Commuter Workshop.

‌
Why should I attend New Student Orientation?

Research indicates students who attend orientation transition more positively in college, both academically and socially. To ensure a smooth transition, we encourage you to take advantage of the opportunities and events provided. WOW is mandatory as each has been planned with a specific purpose important for your success here at Concordia. New Student Orientation is the best way to meet new people, while having a ton of fun!

‌
What if I cannot attend New Student Orientation?

You are encouraged to rearrange your vacation dates or work obligations to make attendance at New Student Orientation a priority. Start your year off right at Concordia with the foundation that orientation provides. It is critical for all new students to go through Orientation Check-in as this affects your student status. Please contact the Office of Orientation and First- Year Experience at (949) 214-3065 if you are unable to attend due to legitimate reasons.

‌
Why is there a fee for New Student Orientation?

All new students (freshman, transfers, international) are assessed a one-time mandatory New Student Orientation fee in their first semester of enrollment, in addition to tuition charges and other fees. The mandatory orientation fee covers special services, staffing, meals/refreshments, materials and programs for new students during orientation that are not covered by regular operating funds.

‌
How do I pay my New Student Orientation fee?

Your New Student Orientation fee will be assessed on your student account. You will not be required to pay the fee at orientation.

‌
Can I bring my parents and guests?

Definitely! Parents and guests are welcome to attend orientation. Parents, family, and supporters play a very important role in helping you transition as well as be successful in your college career. Refer your parents and guests to our Parent Welcome page to learn how they can be involved at Concordia and we encourage them to attend the sessions designed specifically for them. However, we ask that you are intentional about the number of cars that you bring to campus so that we can accommodate all new students and guests.

‌
If I'm coming from afar, what options do I have for hotels and transportation?

View the Hotel & Travel page to access the nearby hotels available for your parents/guests to stay at as well as directions and transportation options to the Concordia campus. In case you haven't visited our campus before, view the Campus Map to familiarize yourself with where to go upon your arrival.

‌
What is a PAL?

Peer Advising Leaders (PALs) are returning students who are eager to help you transition smoothly to Concordia. They are highly involved in orientation, both fall and spring. They are the first peer resources you meet upon your arrival on campus. Tr
