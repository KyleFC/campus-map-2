Build a Career in International Business
What Do You Like About Your Major?

International trade and globalization are major drivers in business today. The ability of firms to remain competitive and flourish increasingly depends on their management’s ability to understand, navigate, and serve global markets. As noted by the Chief Economist at Morgan Stanley, almost 31% of the world’s output of goods and services crosses a national border; this is up 10% from the mid-1990s and double the pre-globalization ratio of the mid-1970s. The trend line will continue.

If you wish to broaden your global horizons and build a career in international business, then the international business emphasis is designed specifically for you.

Senior practitioners regularly comment on the significant shortage of “global trade literate,” culturally sensitive managers. Those with such skills are in high demand, and firms are concerned that such talent is not being developed in sufficient numbers.

With a degree in Business Administration: International Business, you will be prepared for career opportunities in:
