CUI MAGAZINE
Spring 2021 Issue

A note about the Spring 2021 Issue: The Spring 2021 Issue of CUI Magazine was published with four distinct covers to celebrate the successful completion of Forward in Faith - the Campaign for Concordia. Concordia University Irvine is blessed with a diverse student body who pursue many different vocations. Each of their stories are different; all were impacted by the Forward in Faith campaign. The students selected represent just a few of our different student populations: a student in our doctoral program in education, an international student and athlete, a future Lutheran high school teacher, and a transfer student in our music program. Their experiences illustrate the beautiful and varied ways that CUI shapes and prepares students to go out from this campus and serve the world.
