rs-course material, printing, etc.
Room and board: If you choose to live off-campus, you will need to budget for monthly rent, furnishing, utilities, and your meals. You may want to share an apartment with other students to alleviate the cost. Now is the time to fine-tune your cooking skills. It's expensive to eat out all the time.
Transportation: If you commute, be sure to factor in the cost of public transportation, gas, and car insurance. Don't forget the cost of breaks and holiday travel. For example, think about how many times you'll want to go home. You can lower these costs by carpooling or shopping around for student rates on airfare.
Payment Options (If you have a "Balance Due")
Federal Parent PLUS Loan: (Parent Loan for Undergraduate Students) is an affordable, low-interest loan designed for parents. With the PLUS Loan, you can borrow up to your child's total cost of education minus other financial aid awarded to the student.
Alternative Loans: An Educational Loan made in the student's name, but usually require a co-borrower. The co-borrower does not have to be a parent but requires good credit history. No FAFSA is necessary to apply for Alternative loans.
Monthly Payment Plan: Concordia University offers a monthly payment plan through TuitionPay.
