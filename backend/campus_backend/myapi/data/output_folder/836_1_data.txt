CLEP

The College-Level Examination ProgramÂ® (CLEP) gives you the opportunity to receive college credit for what you already know by earning qualifying scores on any of 33 examinations. Earn credit for knowledge you've acquired through independent study, prior course work, on-the-job training, professional development, cultural pursuits, or internships.

DSST (Dantes)

DSST is an effective method to provide you evidence of prior learning. In fact, the 38 exams available at a competitive fee compliment other credit by exam programs such as CLEP. Prior learning assessment will help you accelerate your path to degree completion while saving you the time it takes to sit through a course, as well as the additional dollars spent on tuition.

LearningCounts.org

LearningCounts.org is CAEL's (Council for Adult & Experiential Learning) online service offering credible, third-party assessment of college-level learning acquired outside the college classroom.
