ON-CAMPUS JOBS
Center for Career & Vocation

The primary objective of student employment is to enhance the students’ education by nurturing strong work habits and Christian ethics. Part of Concordia’s mission is to empower students to become individuals of lifelong learning and service. This takes place in the workplace as much as it does in the classroom. The objective of the student employee is to afford the best and most effective efforts on the job, develop good work habits, and to be of service.
