Financial Aid for Continuing Students

The following are steps to be followed to assure that qualified students can be offered financial aid. This includes need-based aid and non need-based aid, such as academic scholarships and program scholarships (Athletics, Music, Theatre, Visual Arts, etc).

Concordia University's institutional aid must go towards institutional charges, such as tuition, fees, university housing, and meal plans. It does not cover university class fees, fines, etc. Academic and Athletic Scholarships and Department Awards, including need-based aid, are known as Concordia institutional aid.

Financial Aid & Study Abroad

After a student is accepted to a Study Abroad program, the Concordia Financial Aid Office will adjust the student's estimated Cost of Attendance (COA) based on the cost sheet for the student's particular Study Abroad program. Students must continue to meet all federal regulations to be eligible for financial aid, such as Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP), enrolling full-time (12 units), course work must count towards degree, etc. All financial aid recipients who are accepted to a study abroad program are required to meet with the Financial Aid Office where they will receive specific information on how Study Abroad may affect their financial aid.
