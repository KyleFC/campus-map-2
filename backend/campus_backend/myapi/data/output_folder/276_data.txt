About Concordia
Concordia University Irvine in the Community

The Concordia University Irvine community is a vibrant one, both on and off campus. Our community extends far beyond our hill-top campus to Southern California, the Pacific Southwest District, and indeed the world. If you are a donor/friend, neighbor, local church, parent or alumnus/a of Concordia University Irvine, Christ College Irvine, or California Concordia College, you are a part of our community. If you are looking for ways to get involved, please take a moment to visit our various constituency pages or to read more about the various ways we are living out the Great Commission.
