Guided Tour of Grimm Hall 
Grimm Hall - North & South

The breezeway between the two wings of Grimm Hall is busy with students and professors greeting each other between the many classes the building hosts. Business and Economics Majors consider Grimm their home base. The South wing of Grimm is home to the largest classroom on campus, Denault Auditorium, which holds 200 students for Freshman Seminar. The North wing houses many student services like Undergraduate Admissions, Financial Aid, and the offices that manage tuition payments and registration.
