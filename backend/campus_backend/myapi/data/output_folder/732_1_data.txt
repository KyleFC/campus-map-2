Reformation and Music

Dr. Jeff Held presented at the Concordia Reformation Lectures at Christ Lutheran Church (Costa Mesa) on June 11, 2017.

A Mighty Fortress is Our God - Dan Forrest

Commissioned by The Concordia Choir and Concordia Sinfonietta for the 500th anniversary of the Reformation.

The setting opens and closes with the blows of Luther’s hammer ringing through history; the piece itself works its way through Luther’s original Renaissance setting, Bach’s famous harmonization, and more modern treatment which nevertheless draws from Luther’s original melody and rhythms. Suitable for worship or concert settings, while never becoming unnecessarily difficult.

Scored for organ and SATB choir with optional congregation. Optional available accompaniments available for piano (compatible with any of the other options), or brass and percussion, or full orchestra. An accompaniment CD recording is also available (organ/brass/percussion version). Also available for SSAA or TTBB choirs.

JESAIA, DEM PROPHETEN (from Urania, 1613) - Michael Praetorius, arr. by Jeff Held

A triple choir motet, arranged for three antiphonal groups of wind instruments

"Isaiah, Mighty Seer in Days of Old" (JESAIA, DEM PROPHETEN) is a hymn that is known as Luther's German Sanctus, as incorporated in his Deutsche Messe of 1526. The melody is a free adaptation of an old church plainsong chant. Luther's musical advisor, Johann Walter, commented that this hymn expertly merges text and melodic gesture. The 1613 antiphonal setting of this hymn, by Michael Praetorius, does the same through triumphant musical emphasis on the repeated words, "Holy is God, the Lord of Sabaoth." This transcription, for groups of wind instruments, retains a close depiction of this text.

"From Depths of Woe I Cry to Thee" (AUS TIEFER NOT) is a confessional hymn by Luther that paraphrases Psalm 130.
