Emely Shares:

This is a great chance to be a part of the community while earning a helpful financial bonus.

What is an experience that has impacted you at your service site?

At my service site, the most impactful time for me is spent working with all the animals and educating children about the importance of eating fruits and vegetables.

Emely Torres serves at Tanaka Farms, a local farm in Irvine, where she tends animals and educates the public. She works as a barnyard attendant feeding animals, cleaning the facilities, and greeting guests. The experience has shown her the benefit of giving back to one’s community while helping her develop poise under pressure and improve her time management skills–all traits that will make a life impact beyond her service work. Being more invested in her community is a benefit above and beyond the financial assistance.
