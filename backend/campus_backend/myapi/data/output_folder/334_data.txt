Diversity Awareness

LEAD Diversity Awareness coordinators focus on programming that both acknowledges and celebrates the diversity of Godâ€™s creation. In addition to campus-wide celebrations of culture and trips to cultural festivals, museums, and centers around Southern California, coordinators provide a safe space for students to explore their ethnic identity and develop their sense of self.
