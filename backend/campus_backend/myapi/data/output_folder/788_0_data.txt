How do I find out if the library has a book?

All library materials are listed in the online catalog. You can also find information on how to use the library’s resources on our libguide.

Where are the STACKS?

The STACKS, also known as the Main Reading Room, hold most of our collection and are located at the back of the library on the lower level of the Schroeder Library and Learning Commons. The collection is organized by the Library of Congress (LC) Classification System, a series of letters and numbers. The ends of the shelves are labeled to help you search. See the Library Map to find where your book may be or ask for help at the Circulation.

When are my books due?

You can bring your ID card to the library and ask an employee at the main desk to renew your books.
You can renew your books yourself from OneSearch. Click the 'Sign In' button in the upper right-hand corner of the page. Log in using your E# and Blackboard password. A list will appear with all the books you have checked out and their due dates. Click on "Renew" next to any item to renew it. There is only one renewal per item.
What do I do if you don't have a book I really need?

How much are your overdue fines?

Books are 25¢/day. Recalls and Interlibrary Loan items are $1.00/day. Reserve items are $5.00/day.
