Emancipation Proclamation 
VIEW TRANSCRIPTION
 

Issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863, the Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves of the Confederate States of America in the midst of the Civil War. Intended as a war measure to cripple the Confederacy, it was pivotal in changing the focus of the war from simply preserving the Union to including the abolition of slavery as well. At the conclusion of the war, Lincoln championed a constitutional amendment to abolish slavery, a goal finally achieved with ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment in December 1865, months after Lincoln’s assassination.
