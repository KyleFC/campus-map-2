Evelyn Shares:

I will continue to serve in my community for years to come because of my experience with the College Corps Program.

What led you to apply for the College Corps Program?

I wanted to give back to my community by doing something out of my comfort zone—volunteering— which I had never done before.

The #CaliforniansForAll College Corps program has been a transformative experience for Evelyn Galvan as she serves at South County Outreach to end hunger and give hope to Orange County families in need. At the South County Outreach facility’s marketplace, Evelyn engages with clients while bagging food items, reviewing grocery list items, and assisting with their grocery needs. She also stocks the pantry and keeps the fridges clean and organized. Through this fulfilling experience, Evelyn has gained work experience, deeper compassion to serve others, and financial support for college. Evelyn intends to continue serving in her community for years to come because of this experience.
