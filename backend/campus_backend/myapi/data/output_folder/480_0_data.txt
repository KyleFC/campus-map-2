Curriculum Vitae

Dr. Sean Bignami, Ph. D., graduated from the University of California at Santa Barbara with a B.S. in Aquatic Biology and minor in Athletic Coaching, and the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science with a Ph. D. in Marine Biology and Fisheries. His doctoral research investigated the effects of ocean acidification (ocean pH change) on larval marine fishes. Dr. Bignami is the founder and Director of the CUI Marine Lab , which supports Concordia University Irvine classes, student and faculty research, and a mobile touch-tank educational outreach program. His current research interests span a range of areas in the marine sciences, including experimental, ecological, and fisheries/conservation biology. Current projects include the study of ocean acidification, impact of sea star wasting disease on intertidal communities, and assessment of Pismo clam populations in southern California. Dr. Bignami also serves as the advisor of Concordia’s Epsilon Chi Delta Chapter of the Beta Beta Beta National Biological Honor Society. He especially enjoys including and advising students in research and outreach programs, and providing an opportunity for them to explore their faith as it intersects with their passion for science.
