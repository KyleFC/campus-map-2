2019 Hispanic Leadership Conference

Saturday, October 26, 2019
8 a.m.-2 p.m.
Concordia University Irvine

Created for high school girls in 9th-12th grade, and those currently enrolled in community college—along with one parent/guardian—Concordia’s Hispanic Leadership Conference is designed to help attendees navigate the road to college. The leadership conference offers inspiring speakers, stories, college major breakout sessions, and panels—including a new panel for parents of future first-generation college students. The conference is free, but space is limited and registration is required.

Learn about past conference speakers, sponsors, and workshops under “Previous Years."

College is not a dream. It’s a plan.
