What Is Eloquence?

Eloquence can be defined as speaking and writing well, or moving another's soul toward good by sharing the truth in love. An eloquent person thinks critically and articulates thoughts clearly in order to effectively participate in society. To accomplish this, what oral and written delivery techniques—such as language, tone and organization—should be utilized to engage and enhance the presentation to the intended audience? How should logos, pathos and ethos be used to influence the audience? Courses that address eloquence deal with its definitions and purposes, and develop students as eloquent speakers or writers through repeated practice.

How Do I Understand Nature?

Modern society uses the natural sciences to make sense of the universe, understand how it operates, and help us understand our place in it. A “wise, honorable, and cultivated citizen” needs to be aware of worldview and how it affects one’s view of the natural (and the supernatural) world. To ponder all that is real, one must ask and answer hard questions that continue to vex us, questions such as: What is truth? What is science? How do faith and science relate? Can I know the reality of God like the reality of the atom? How should humanity interact with nature? Courses that explore these (and other related) questions will help students know why they believe what they know about nature and how to articulate their thoughts in an educated manner.
