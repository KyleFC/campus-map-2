andards. Program Applicants will be required to verify that they understand and meet the above technical standards or that they believe that, with certain accommodations, they can meet these standards. All students will be evaluated first with regard to their academic and program qualifications and all students will be evaluated using a rating systems in the competitive admissions process. To promote fairness and equality, the program seeks to identify a suitable candidate before discussing anyone’s disability status. Once a determination is made that a candidate is ’otherwise qualified’, discussions will begin regarding whether the Athletic Training Program can make reasonable accommodations to a student who has identified that they require accommodations. Compliance with the Program’s technical standards does not guarantee a student’s eligibility for the BOC© certification exam. Students with a concern, should contact the BOC© for the specific technical standards needed to take the certification examination (bocatc.org). Students seeking academic accommodations must provide medical documentation of their disability and comply with the procedures of Concordia University and the Disability and Learning Center (DLCR). Failure to give notice or provide detailed information to the DLCR may result in your accommodations being delayed or your requests being denied. You may view the DLCR policies at www.cui.edu/studentlife/disability-access-services.
