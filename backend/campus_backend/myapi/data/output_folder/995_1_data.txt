l illness. F-1 students who require additional time to complete their academic program must submit an I-20 Request Form and a letter from Academic Advisor to PDSO/DSO one month before the current I-20 expiration date.

5. Always obtain Employment Authorization before you begin working

Students must ALWAYS obtain written employment authorization from PDSO/DSO and/or U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service BEFORE beginning any employment, including on- and off-campus employment. More information is also available in the Employment section of this website.

6. Notify the U.S. Immigration Service and ISSS of any address change.

Submit Change of Address Form (AR-11) PDSO/DSO to update your address change within 15 days of moving. Your local address is added to your SEVIS record and reporting this change is part of maintaining your status.

You are responsible for updating this information and it is a violation of your status if you fail to do so.

7. Leave the US within 60 days after completing your program.

Once you complete all requirements for your program, even if your I-20 has not expired, you have only 60 days to either:

leave the United States
change to another visa status
begin a new program of study (this requires a new I-20)

Failure to comply results in the loss of your F-1 status!
