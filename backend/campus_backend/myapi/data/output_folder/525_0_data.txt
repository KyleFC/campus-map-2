DOCTOR OF EDUCATION (Ed.D.) IN LEADERSHIP
Educational Administration

For school-level and district-level administrators, and leaders in faith-based institutions and other educational settings

Educational Administration

External demand for doctorates in educational administration will continue to steadily grow over both the long and short term, in large part due to competition among educators to land administrative positions within schools and school districts. Demand for administrators to fill vacated or new administrative positions should continue to moderately increase in the coming years. Many educators also pursue Ed.D. degrees for reasons other than for administration positions, including such positions as educational policymaker, professor, and educational consultant, among others.

Educational Administration is designed to enhance the leadership knowledge and skills of educators to effectively manage human and fiscal resources in a sustainable way that supports learning for all students. Featured courses include Technology in a Systems Approach to Leadership, Strategic Human Resource Management and Development, and Sustained Fiscal Leadership for Organizational Effectiveness. Content covered within this Specialization further aligns the Ed.D. degree with the eight leadership competencies for the State of California’s Clear Administrative Services Credential. We also offer an Advanced Graduate Certificate in Educational Administration.
