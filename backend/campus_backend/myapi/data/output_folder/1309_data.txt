Explore Our New Marketing Campaign

For nearly 50 years, Concordia University Irvine has been preparing students for lives of learning, service, and leadership through distinctive Lutheran education. Our community and curriculum is uniquely designed to give students the freedom to ask life’s toughest questions, develop their own relationship with God, and prepare for all of their callings in life.

The “Freedom to Explore” campaign highlights our extraordinary Concordia community and shows how a private Christian education is not only high quality but also an experience of unparalleled exploration and growth by design — personally, professionally, and spiritually. The campaign concept was the culmination of months of research and brand workshops with stakeholders from across the University and Irvine community.

To bring the concept to life, a weeklong video and photo shoot was produced in June 2022 on our beautiful campus and around Greater Irvine. You’ll see iconic locations such as the CU Center, Good Shepherd Chapel, French Hill, Newport Beach, and Balboa Island. You may even see some familiar faces — our own Concordia students, alumni, faculty, and staff members volunteered to be featured in our production shoot!

This campaign, paired with our rebrand, communicates to the world what a unique educational experience we have here at Concordia. A huge thank you goes out to everyone involved in developing this campaign — from our students, alumni, faculty, and staff to our Board of Regents, Board of Trustees, and members of the Irvine community. We couldn’t have built such a special and authentic campaign without you.

 
Meet the Cast

Our campaign features real Concordia students, alumni, faculty, and staff who generously volunteered their time and talents to be part of the photos and video shoot. Meet some of these dynamic individuals, read their stories, and learn why they love being part of our Concordia community.
