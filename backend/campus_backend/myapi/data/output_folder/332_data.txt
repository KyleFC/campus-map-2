ASCUI Senate
About ASCUI Senate

ASCUI Senate is the primary voice of students in policy-making activities and is comprised of elected representatives from residence halls as well as commuter students. Functioning under the leadership of the ASCUI Vice President, Senate serves as the "middle man" between students and upper level Administration. We do this through collecting feedback (ideas/desired changes the students want to see) and relaying them to the Vice President in weekly meetings. Our meetings take place every Wednesday in Grimm Hall 128 from 10:30-11am.
