Advent with Concordia

As we prepare for Christmas this year, we’ve been thinking about a custom from Central and South America known as Las Posadas. This is a festive reenactment of the journey to Bethlehem where the holy family seeks shelter and a place for Christ to be born. Since there was no room in the inns (las posadas), they take shelter in a stable.

This Advent, we invite you to join us, in weekly devotions, on a journey to Bethlehem with the holy family. As we remember their journey, we see our own journeys and, ultimately, are welcomed by God’s gracious hospitality.

God be with you as you journey in this holy season.

Steve Mueller
Vice President, Chief Mission Officer
