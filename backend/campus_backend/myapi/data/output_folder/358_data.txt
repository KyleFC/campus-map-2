The K-Tel All Stars are a far out representation of a concert straight out of the 70s. Their show consists of Number-One Hits, One-Hit Wonders, AM Radio Gold, and Iconic Rock Hits from 1970 to 1979. Here’s the skinny; you’ll know every song!

Their stellar performances have received high praises from distinguished members of Rare Earth, The Raspberries, The Little River Band, Three Dog Night, and Mickey Thomas' Band, along with a myriad of tribute acts across the U.S. who have all deemed The K-Tel All-Stars to be, “The Best Band Ever.”

Join us for an epic night of music, dancing and nostalgia as the band takes you on a journey back in time to revisit unforgettable gems that have become the soundtrack of our lives.

It’s time to get groovy! So, slide into your favorite pair of bell bottoms, put on your mood ring, and hang up your Farrah Fawcett poster because The K-Tel All-Stars are coming. And that can only mean one thing… THE 70s ARE BACK
