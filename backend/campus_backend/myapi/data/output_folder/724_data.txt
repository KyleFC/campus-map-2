Curriculum Vitae




Reverend Eschelbach was a parish pastor for 15 years before teaching at Concordia University Chicago (14 years) and now Concordia University Irvine. The care of souls and love of truth are evident in his eagerness to help others find the answers they seek, especially answers to the most difficult questions. Professor Eschelbach invests himself in his students as he shows them how to search for the truth among the various witnesses God has provided, especially in the Bible but also in nature, reason, and common human experience. You may find evidence of Dr. Eschelbach’s work in his publications, public speaking, and recognition for exemplary teaching. Besides teaching and studies, Michael Eschelbach enjoys sailing, biking along Newport beach, and visiting the redwoods.

Curriculum Vitae

Hi! My name is Mike Middendorf, a Professor of Theology. I am privileged to teach a wide of variety of courses related to the Bible (e.g. Old and New Testament, Greek and Hebrew, and many more!). It is a great opportunity to lead classes on three levels at one University! My favorite group to work with is our undergraduate students, but I also get to teach courses in the Master of Arts program and to seminarians studying here for many types of ethnic ministry. My home state is Minnesota and my college is a sister school of Concordia - Irvine, located in St. Paul, MN. After completing my pastor’s degree and a doctorate at Concordia Seminary in St. Louis, I was a parish pastor at Concordia Lutheran Church in Jamestown, ND. Then I served as professor for 9 years at another sister Concordia, in Austin, TX, before coming to Irvine. Is that enough Concordia’s for you? Well, yet another Concordia, Concordia Publishing House, asked me to write a two-volume commentary on the book of Romans for their Concordia Commentary series. Volume one was published in 2013; volume two in 2016. I also co-authored the New Testament textbook used here and at other Concordias titled, Called by the Gospel. In addition to digging into the Bible, I have worked on an archaeology dig three summers at Hippos on the shore of the Sea of Galilee in Israel. After all those Concordias, I should point out that “Concordia” is from two Latin words which literally mean “with heart.” That is one phrase which I strive to have as a characteristic of my teaching ministry. “Concordia” is also often translated as “harmony.” Since coming to Concordia in 2001, I have really found that to be an outstanding description of the Christian community here.
