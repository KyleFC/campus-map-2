Take the first step toward advancing your career.

The Townsend Institute has earned a reputation for its relational approach that begins with character growth as a building block for positive change. Our graduate-level certificates offer a foundational knowledge in each of the three areas. Should you wish to continue your education, the certificate program coursework can apply to the corresponding Master's degree at the Townsend Institute.

We believe that in order to be an effective leader, your personal growth is a priority. Students enrolled in the Certificate program have the same access to the 4-day, in-person course where Dr. Townsend, Townsend Institute faculty, and Fellows will conduct a series of trainings to jump-start your learning.
