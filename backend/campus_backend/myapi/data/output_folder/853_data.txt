INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD
First Steps

All researchers (and their supervisors) must complete CITI HSR Training or have a valid CITI HSR Certificate whose expiration date is no less than the closing date of the research project. The estimated time to complete the training is 4-5 hours. This training is a federal requirement and will prepare you for the IRB process and human subjects research.

Human Subjects Research (HSR)

Your first step is to determine whether or not you are conducting Human Subjects Research. If you are not conducting Human Subjects Research, IRB does not have jurisdiction over your research â€“ please contact your supervisor for next steps. If your study involves Human Subjects Research, you will need to determine if your study is EXEMPT.
