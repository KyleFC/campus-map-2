OFFICE OF RESIDENCE LIFE
Upper/Lower Quads

The Upper and Lower Quads have acquired these fond nicknames on campus because each set of four buildings shares a common courtyard. The “Upper Quads” consist of Chi Omicron, Chi Kappa, Chi Lambda, and Chi Theta. The “Lower Quads” consist of Chi Delta, Chi Epsilon, Chi Gamma, and Chi Zeta. These residence halls are apartment-style and normally consist of upper-classmen. Freshmen may apply to live in some of the Living Learning Communities under certain circumstances. Living Learning Communities are located in the Upper Quads, but have the same floor plan as Lower Quads. For more information on LLCs, please visit the LLC webpage.
