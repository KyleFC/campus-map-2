Pastor Day
September 17, 2021
Friday, September 17, 2021
Concordia University Irvine

Pastor Day at Concordia is a chance for the university to thank those who serve as pastor to our students, as pastors in our community, and as pastors in our LCMS District. In addition to celebrating you in our chapel service that day, we will also make sure that you eat well and get a Pastor Day memento to take home. In the spirit of servant leadership, we will also offer the pastors in attendance an opportunity to serve the students, faculty, and staff of Concordia.
