A Grand Welcome from our New President

Faith-based institutions today play a vital role in our nation as they train nurses, doctors, teachers and others who serve with conviction in the public sector. That’s why I’m thrilled to serve alongside such a dedicated group of faculty and staff who put students and their families at the very center of what we do.
