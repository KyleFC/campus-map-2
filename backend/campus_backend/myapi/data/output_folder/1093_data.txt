HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
Online Bachelor's Degree

Concordia University Irvine is no longer enrolling new students for the online bachelor's degree in Healthcare Management (HLMG). We invite you to explore other options in our School of Health and Human Sciences that include a traditional BA in Healthcare Management, a Master of Healthcare Administration, and other related Healthcare Programs.
