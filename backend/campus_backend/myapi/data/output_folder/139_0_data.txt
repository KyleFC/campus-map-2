Dual Credential Program
Single Subject Credential + Education Specialist Mild/Moderate Credential

Candidates will complete coursework and fieldwork leading to two separate credentials for Single Subject, authorizing candidates to teach one subject to groups of students at the middle to the high school level, and an Education Specialist credential that authorizes candidates to teach students (K-12) with mild to moderate disabilities.

The Dual Credential requires one additional semester of 11 units. To work toward a dual credential, you will complete a carefully designed sequence of coursework for both programs, followed by one semester of student teaching. Half of your student teaching will be in a general education setting and half will be in a special education setting.
