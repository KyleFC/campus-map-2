PURCHASE BOOK

Dean Stoecker is the co-founder and executive chairman of Alteryx, a multi-billion dollar data analytics company. But his path to that success was not linear or logical or without its deep swamps of despair. Dean had many entrepreneurial false starts before he finally found his path. In this candid, engaging book, he describes the emotional journey that inevitably accompanies any success in life. We all want to create something great—a great marriage, a great friendship, a great career, a great family, and if you’re as fortunate as Dean, a great business. But building any masterpiece is as difficult as it is rewarding. People give up. They lose confidence. They can’t get through the tough parts. But, as Dean’s own story shows, most failures are not failures of vision or talent, but of belief and will. In fact, they’re not even failures at all. If you can learn to navigate the often overwhelming obstacles and dark moments, your efforts will be rewarded. Based on Stoecker’s years of hard-earned wisdom, Masterpiece is much more than a window onto the founding of a tech giant. It offers universal and timeless lessons for any journey you might be on.
