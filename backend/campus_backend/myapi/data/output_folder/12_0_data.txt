THE arts

The Arts are at the heart of Concordia University Irvine. Consider how worship is enhanced when our voices and instruments rise in song. Look to the stories that are brought to life in the theatre — they show us that we are not alone. In creativity, we express our humanity, as we reflect the image of a creative God.

As makers, musicians, and performers, we invite you to be a part of this vibrant creative community. Here you will find the freedom to explore your artistic interests and vocations while growing in your skills as a thinker, collaborator, and leader.

Music at Concordia

Our aim is to develop general musicianship, performance, musical collaboration, and critical listening, along with an understanding of various contexts of music. Ensembles — comprised of orchestras, jazz, choirs, worship, commercial music, handbell, and chamber — are open to students studying to be music professionals, as well as students who are non-music majors but desire to perform for the joy of music.

Theatre at Concordia

The craft of acting, the art of design, and the nuance of directing are pursuits for students who care deeply about story and recognize the impact theatre, television, and video can have on shaping our world view.
