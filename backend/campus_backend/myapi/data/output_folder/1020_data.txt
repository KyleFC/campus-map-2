About Rho Phi

Through a variety of philanthropic and social activities, Rho Phi inspires its members to adopt important values such as leadership, empathy, and ambition, and to always strive for excellence.

Since 2014, members have upheld these values through academic success, philanthropy, character development, and solid relationship-building skills. Our members are actively involved in many events throughout the year, allowing them to create lifelong bonds and consistently give back to the community.
