ges and real world issues. Students are challenged intellectually, while developing their spiritual and ethical habits as wise, honorable and cultivated citizens.

 
Music

The Music Department teaches students to imagine, create, perform, and contextualize God’s gift of music with excellence, cultivating an experience of expressive humanity within their community, one that transcends knowledge and ultimately reminds them of freedom, relationship, and divine love.

 
Psychology, Sociology, & Anthropology

The Department of Psychology, Sociology, and Anthropology is uniquely positioned to understand Christ’s words of “Love thy neighbor as thyself.” No other field of study examines love, neighbor, and self as directly as the Behavioral Sciences. We examine the cultural, societal, and personal constructs that facilitate or impede the understanding of these ideas.

 
Theatre

Theatre students examine and experience what it means to be human, through both the reading and production of plays; while acknowledging sinfulness and its role in conflict, Concordia theatre is unique because we explore this in the context of the fruits of the Spirit (Gal 5:22-23). In this way, the art of storytelling becomes a collaborative endeavor whereby students must learn principles of wisdom, honor, and cultivation in order to connect successfully with an audience.
