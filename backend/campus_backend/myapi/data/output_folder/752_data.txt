ENROLL NOW

You must log in to MyRecords to set up a payment plan. Please follow the instructions below.

After logging into MyRecords, from the menu above, select My Student Bill.
From the My Student Bill menu, select My Student Bill, you will be directed to Transact billing.
At the student Summary Section, scroll down to the "Payment Plans" option to get started.

Our Tuition Payment Plans are a third-party payment plan administered by Transact as an interest-free alternative to a direct one-time payment.

Students may enroll per semester (Summer, Fall, or Spring) and Payment Plans will be made available starting mid-May for new academic years.

You will be asked to enter a Plan Amount for the semester. To calculate your Plan Amount, please use our Calculating Cost Worksheet.

If you have questions regarding your Plan Amount for the TuitionPay payment plan, please contact the Bursar's Office at (949) 214-3075 or bursar@cui.edu.
