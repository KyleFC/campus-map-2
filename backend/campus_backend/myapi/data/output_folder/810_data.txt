State Notifications
‌
Alaska

Concordia University Irvine is exempt from authorization under AS 14.48 and 20 AAC 17.015 because the program is online or distance delivered and does not have a physical presence in the state.

‌
Louisiana

Concordia University Irvine is currently licensed by the Board of Regents of the State of Louisiana. Licenses are renewed by the State Board of Regents every two years. Licensed institutions have met minimal operational standards set forth by the state, but licensure does not constitute accreditation, guarantee the transferability of credit, nor signify that programs are certifiable by any professional agency or organization.

‌
Minnesota

Concordia University Irvine is registered with the Minnesota Office of Higher Education pursuant to Minnesota Statutes sections 136A.61 to 136A.71. Registration is not an endorsement of the institution. Credits earned at the institution may not transfer to all other institutions.

‌
Texas

Concordia University Irvine is not regulated in Texas under Chapter 132 of the Texas Education Code

‌
Virginia

Concordia University Irvine is certified to operate by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia. The transferability of credits earned at the school is at the sole discretion of the receiving institution. Completion of the M.A. Counseling program is sufficient to meet licensure requirements in Virginia.

‌
Washington

Concordia University Irvine is authorized by the Washington Student Achievement Council and meets the requirements and minimum educational standards established for degree-granting institutions under the Degree-Granting Institutions Act. This authorization is subject to periodic review and authorizes Concordia University Irvine to offer field placement components for specific degree programs. The Council may be contacted for a list of currently authorized programs. Authorization by the Council does not carry with it an endorsement by the Council of the institution or its programs. Any person desiring information about the requirements of the act or the applicability of those requirements to the institution may contact the Council at P.O. Box 43430, Olympia, WA 98504-3430 or by email at degreeauthorization@wsac.wa.gov.

The transferability of credits earned at Concordia University Irvine is at the discretion of the receiving college, university, or other educational institution. Students considering transferring to any institution should not assume that credits earned in any program of study at Concordia University Irvine will be accepted by the receiving institution. Similarly, the ability of a degree, certificate, diploma, or other academic credential earned at Concordia University Irvine to satisfy an admission requirement of another institution is at the discretion of the receiving institution. Accreditation does not guarantee credentials or credits earned at Concordia University Irvine will be accepted by or transferred to another institution. To minimize the risk of having to repeat coursework, students should contact the receiving institution in advance for evaluation and determination of transferability of credits and/or acceptability of degrees, diplomas, or certificates earned.

The Washington Student Achievement Council (WSAC) has authority to investigate student complaints against specific schools. WSAC may not be able to investigate every student complaint. Visit https://www.wsac.wa.gov/student-complaints for information regarding the WSAC complaint process.

For Washington State residents seeking information and resources about student loan repayment or seeking to submit a complaint relating to your student loans or student loan servicer, please visit www.wsac.wa.gov/loan-advocacy or contact the Student Loan Advocate at loanadvocate@wsac.wa.gov
