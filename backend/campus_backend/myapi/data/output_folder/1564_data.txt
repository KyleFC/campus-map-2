Choral Music Festival

Concordia University Irvine proudly presents its inaugural Summer Choral Festival at the Borland-Manske Center, tailored for students ranging from 3rd grade to 12th grade. This festival offers participants the unique opportunity to engage in choral singing within a supportive environment while also benefiting from enriching classes and seminars designed to enhance their musicianship.

Our primary mission for this festival is to provide young musicians with a platform to develop their singing skills, express their emotions through music, learn the importance of collaboration and socialization, and to praise God through their voices and hearts. We believe that the choral setting offers an ideal environment for learning these essential life skills, and we are committed to providing a nurturing and enriching experience for all participants.
