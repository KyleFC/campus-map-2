FirstGen Tips
Tips for Parents of FirstGen College Students
From FirstGen Concordia Alumni
You have given your child a strong foundation, and now is their chance to build on what you’ve taught them. An education is one of the most important decisions they will make, and will lead them to a life of even greater opportunities.

Encourage your child to stay at school on the weekend, rather than coming home.

Dr. Buddy Mendez

Financial aid is important. And, be prepared for change.

Concordia puts opportunities there for anyone to grasp, and I've tried to take all of them as best as I could.

There are many resources out there. Don’t be afraid to ask or look it up online.

Get to know your professors and ask them questions about everything and anything.

Dr. Buddy Mendez

Pay attention to deadlines, especially for scholarships and grants. And be proactive about financial assistance.

From FirstGen Concordia Alumni
I was born and raised in the inner city and my parents taught me to set my dreams and goals high. Education provided the access and knowledge to make my dreams a reality. I now enjoy a dual career as an executive at an entertainment company, and a university professor. I am proof of the American Dream, and I have my education to thank for that.
