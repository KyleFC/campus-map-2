Steve Young, director

Concordia’s commercial music program is a diverse, immersive experience, designed to prepare the student for the demands that face today’s music professionals. The curriculum, which emphasizes both musicianship and artistry, extends beyond the classroom as students learn and perform in small ensembles as well as one-on-one study in areas such as performance, composition/songwriting, arranging and music production. Concordia’s close proximity to the Los Angeles music industry provides a fertile ground for creative interaction, collaboration, and a first-rate faculty.
