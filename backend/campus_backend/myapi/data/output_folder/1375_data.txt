The Concordia Brass provides music in concerts, worship services, and recitals. Depending on the repertoire and performance needs, it will take the format of brass quartet all the way up to full orchestral brass and percussion. The Concordia Brass frequently collaborate with pipe organ. All Concordia Brass members play in the Concordia Wind Orchestra and/or Concordia Sinfonietta.
