2020 Hispanic Leadership Conference
A college road map for community college & high school students

5th Annual Hispanic Leadership Conference for community college and high school students. For the first time, the conference will be open to male students.

OCT

24

Saturday, October 24, 2020
8:30 AM - 11:00 AM
Virtual Event

Since 2016, this FREE event has been inspiring community college and high school students to pursue academic goals for a bright future. Our name might be new now that we’re coed—Latinx—but the goal to help attendees navigate the path to college remains the same. Students will discover that college is not a dream, it’s a plan. The conference offers a toolkit of educational resources about college majors, financial aid, as well as inspiring first-generation speakers, industry professionals, and a keynote. Parents can also join their own breakout session—in Spanish/en español—that offers valuable resources on what to expect as their child begins their college journey. The virtual conference ends with a college Information Fair.
