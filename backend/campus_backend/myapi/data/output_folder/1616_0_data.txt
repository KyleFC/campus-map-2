Navidad: A Concordia Christmas, Airing on PBS SoCal

This year’s theme, Navidad, reflects on the cherished tradition of Las Posadas. Celebrated in Mexico and other Latin American countries, Las Posadas focuses on Mary and Joseph’s journey door-to-door in search of shelter. After many closed doors, being rejected and turned away, their sojourn ends in a joyful celebration, the wondrous birth of Christ in a humble stable.

Navidad: A Journey to Bethlehem

Celebrate the Christmas season with the voices and instruments of Concordia University Irvine. This year, we are once again blessed to share our annual celebration of the Christmas season with local audiences at the Renée and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall, and with a national audience through our made-for-TV Christmas special featured on PBS.

Christmas Concerts at the Renée and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall

Under the theme Concordia Christmas - Navidad: A Journey to Bethlehem, Concordia's critically-acclaimed choirs, handbells, and orchestra shared a sojourn to the birth of the world's long-awaited Savior! This year's concerts showcased more than 200 performers from eight vocal and instrumental performing ensembles under the masterful direction of Dr. Michael Busch, Dr. Jeff Held, Dr. Clarissa Shan, and Erik Der, with festive carols and Christmas favorites, old and new.

Made-for-TV PBS Christmas Special

Concordia’s celebration of Christmas continues throughout the month of December as Navidad: A Concordia Christmas airing on local and national PBS stations. Concordia’s fourth annual made-for-TV Christmas special includes choral, instrumental, and readings reflecting this year’s theme. Check back in December for local listings.

Our Christmas specials, "Navidad: A Concordia Christmas" and "The Thrill of Hope: A Concordia Christmas," will air on national PBS affiliates throughout the country in the month of December.
