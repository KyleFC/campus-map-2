in October 2022, and Concordia's offer was accepted.

Concordia secured financing with very favorable terms for the building purchase through the Lutheran Church Extension Fund (LCEF).

Per the terms of the purchase agreement, the current building tenant, UMass Global, will continue to lease one floor of the building for approximately 18 months while they transition to a new facility.

Concordia is committed to educating the workforce in Irvine and beyond for the 21st century. This investment is a testimony to Concordia's continued commitment to serve the community of Irvine, even as we get ready to celebrate our 50th anniversary in 2026.

‌
Will the purchase of the new campus impact current tuition rates?

No. There will be no financial impact for Concordia students, as the new campus was purchased using external funds provided by LCEF. This purchase is not being financed through tuition increases, adjustments to financial aid distributions, or changes in student services and/or amenities.
