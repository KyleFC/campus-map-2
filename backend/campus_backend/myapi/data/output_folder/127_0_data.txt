The Pre-Seminary Studies minor furnishes students with the academic training essential for successful entrance into a seminary along with preparation for a successful ministry. Undergraduates who are members of an LCMS congregation and interested in continuing their education at an LCMS seminary may declare the Pre-Seminary Studies minor. They must apply to the Christ College Church Work program prior to declaring the minor.

The program is structured to encourage measured personal and spiritual growth in pastoral attitudes, habits, and skills and also offers a cross-cultural experience. Upon successful completion of the program, students are prepared to enter a seminary that typically includes three additional years of academic work and one year of vicarage.
