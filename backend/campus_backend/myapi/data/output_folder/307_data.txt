CAMPUS MINISTRY

In approaching our call to engage students with the Word and with its good news of Jesus Christ, Concordia's Campus Ministry has determined to challenge all believers to grow through the study of God's Word in a small group setting. Men's and Women's Bible study coordinates small groups that meet at various times throughout the week for the purpose of pursuing dynamic discipleship together in Christ.

To sign up for small group Bible study, please e-mail abbeywest@cui.edu.
