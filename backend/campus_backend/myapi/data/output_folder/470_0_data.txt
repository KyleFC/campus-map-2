If you have a heart for Jesus and a passion for the ministry of teaching in a Lutheran school, consider a minor in Lutheran teaching. Paired with an appropriate major and a teaching credential, it prepares you to teach in Lutheran schools at either the elementary or secondary level. Successful completion of the Christ College certification requirements makes you eligible for a call to teach at a Lutheran school. Upon graduation, Christ College will connect you with Lutheran schools where you can teach.

Those who want to teach at the elementary level are best prepared by being a Liberal Studies major.
Future high school teachers will major in a state-approved single subject content area such as English, history, or physics.

Undergraduates who wish to become Lutheran Teachers must apply to the Christ College Church Work program prior to declaring the Lutheran Teacher minor. Students in Lutheran teaching programs must also complete the requirements for a California teaching credential. Your teaching assignments will include both public school settings and Lutheran schools.
