PARENTS & FAMILIES

Order a special treat for your student for any special occasion! Homemade by Bon Appetit and hand-delivered by The Office of Family Relations, this is sure to bring a smile! Have a sweet treat delivered on your student's birthday, or in celebration of a special accomplishment, recent win, or just because!

Orders must be placed with seven (7) day advance notice. Deliveries can be made to your student's on-campus dorm Monday - Friday between 2:00 pm and 3:00 pm. Deliveries not available on weekends or school breaks/holidays. If the recipient is not available, a note will be left with instructions to pick up their special CU Celebrate treat from Eagles Landing during normal hours. Orders can be made for the entire academic year.
