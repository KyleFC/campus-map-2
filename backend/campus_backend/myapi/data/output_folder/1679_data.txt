Thank You, Donors!

On behalf of the students, faculty, and staff, it is an honor to express our sincere appreciation to these individuals, companies, organizations, and churches. As partners in our ministry, they help make Concordia University Irvine one of America's finest regional liberal arts colleges. This Honor Roll of Donors reflects the value of gifts received July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021.

Graduates of the Last Decade (GOLD) 2021

Graduates of the last decade are alumni who graduated in the last ten years. These recent graduates qualify for Pacesetter benefits when they give $500 cumulative across campus, rather than the traditional membership requirement of $1,000 per year. We thank these donors for supporting Concordia so early on in their careers.
