What is LinkedIn?

LinkedIn is a professional networking site that connects users with employers and fellow employees to exchange information, ideas, and opportunities.  It can also be used to connect prospective students, current students or alumni to programs of interests.

 

Why Should I use LinkedIn?

 

With a LinkedIn profile, you can connect with former classmates, browse job listings by locations and job field, and contact fellow professionals in your field to increase your professional network.

Concordia University Irvine organizations can use LinkedIn by creating groups to connect with students and alumni, and to post job openings for paid positions and internships.
 

How do I use LinkedIn?

Start by creating a LinkedIn profile here.

Enter a valid e-mail address and fill in all required information fields. This will help you find people and organizations that are relevant to your professional interests.

Fill in your profile. The more thorough you are, the better you will be able to utilize LinkedIn's features. Add your web sites, other social media sites, any published or patented material, résumés and other contact information.

Start Networking

Find connections. Click the "Contacts" tab at the top of your profile to search for colleagues and classmates. Click on "Add Connection" to search based on e-mail address, company, location, year of graduation and much more.

Search or post job listings. Search jobs based off of location and job field in the "Jobs" tab. If you are looking to hire an employee or intern, post a job listing here.

Join Groups to discuss topics relevant to your interests, discuss ideas and meet people to network with.
 

Create a LinkedIn Group

Don't focus on "selling" your organization/entity. Rather, put the focus on the group and members. Provide content that would be appealing to them.

Consider using the polling function. Implement a poll to gauge the pulse of the group.

Carry on the conversations. Facilitate group discussions by posting useful information and prompts for future discussions.

Thank people for contributing. If a member becomes a frequent poster, acknowledge them and encourage them to keep it up.

Make introductions between members. Simple introductions can add a personal touch to your group members’ experience.

Promote the group. Promote your group to your personal LinkedIn network or by posting the group URL on external websites and marketing materials.

Create a LinkedIn badge for members to post on their external sites.
