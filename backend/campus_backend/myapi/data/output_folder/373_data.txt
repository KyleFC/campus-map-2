ASSESSMENT AND CARE COMMITTEE
Student Life
Welcome

The Assessment and Care Committee (ACC) is dedicated to assisting our students in their development in order to support them in becoming wise, honorable, and cultivated citizens.

Our Mission

The Assessment and Care Committee is committed to the mission of the University by providing early intervention for students whose patterns of behaviors pose a concern to his/hers overall well-being, health, and safety, or to the safety of the University community. ACC is empowered by the Executive Vice President/Chief Enrollment Officer to make decisions regarding a student’s status within the University community.

As the eyes and ears of our community, it is everyone’s responsibility to take action and assist those students who show any type of behavior that could threaten their own safety or the well-being of the University community. We all play a vital role in ensuring the safety of our students. The ACC strongly encourages you to utilize its referral services to continue to better our students and to further enhance our community.
