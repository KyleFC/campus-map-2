Lutheran Educator's Grant

In order to encourage students to prepare for full-time service in church work professions, Concordia University awards the Christ College Grant to qualified students who are members of an LCMS congregation and who intend to serve in an LCMS church or school after graduation from Concordia, or attend a qualified graduate school or an LCMS seminary. To qualify for the grant, the student must take Christ College courses and complete the application process. This grant is renewable as long as a student meets the requirements for the grant. A student must complete an application annually.

Students must maintain a 2.5 cumulative GPA in all course work and a 2.8 cumulative GPA in required Christ College courses. Students must receive at least a C- in courses required for LCMS certification (including professional programs and/or majors).

Questions about the Christ College Grant may be directed to Carrie Donohoe, Christ College Program Coordinator, 949-214-3389 or carrie.donohoe@cui.edu.
