Final Exam Schedule
OFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR
Final Exam Schedule

Attendance at final exams is expected. Please avoid making travel plans until all of your final exams are completed. Instructors are not required to allow make-up times or reschedule finals because of your travel plans.

Exam times correspond to the first meeting day of your scheduled class. For example, if you are registered for MTH 301 that meets at 1535-1650 on Tuesdays (T) and Thursdays, you would find 3:35 pm TR on the grid. The final would be on Tuesday at 3:00 pm.

Final exams are held in the same classroom as the course. There may still be conflicts in your exam schedule. If you have a conflict, please speak to your instructor(s) to make appropriate arrangements to take your exam(s).
