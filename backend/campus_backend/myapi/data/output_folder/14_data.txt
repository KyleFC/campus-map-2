“I therefore urge you, brothers and sisters, through the mercies of God to present your bodies as a sacrifice that is living, holy, and well-pleasing to God; this is your reasonable worship. And do not be conformed to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind so that you may test and discern what is the good, well-pleasing, and perfect will of God.”

Romans 12:1-2
