Our Story

Founded in 1976, Concordia University Irvine today is one of the region’s leading private nonprofit Christian Lutheran universities. Preparing students for their vocations - their calling in life - Concordia’s Lutheran heritage provides a thoughtful and caring Christian community that lives out the theology of “Grace alone. Faith alone.”

Message from the Department Chair

The Visual Arts Department at Concordia University Irvine offers Art and Graphic Design majors and minors in a rich artistic environment where students can grow intellectually and spiritually as visual artists.

Our faculty each engage in art making themselves, continuing to learn and explore and refine their craft. Concordia is committed to fostering a collaborative community where creative expression is nurtured.

Our facilities include a state-of-the-art Mac Lab, newly-renovated studio art spaces, a ceramics studio, and the John & Linda Friend Gallery.

We invite curiosity - come visit Concordia and explore our Visual Arts.
