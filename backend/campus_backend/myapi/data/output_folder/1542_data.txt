Crosswise Summer Experience
2020 THEME: PLAYING WITH POLITICS: THE VOCATION OF THE VOTER
 
 

Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the 2020 Crosswise summer experience is cancelled. Much thought has gone into this difficult decision, but we feel that an overabundance of caution is warranted in these uncertain times. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families that are affected, as well as those who will be making difficult policy decisions at the national and local levels of government. Crosswise will pour its efforts into making the 2021 event as special as possible! Thank you for understanding during this unprecedented time. We’ll see you next summer!

Playing with Politics: The Vocation of the Voter

There are two topics you're not supposed to talk about in polite conversation: politics and religion. Avoiding these crucial features of human interaction, however, has hurt our ability to understand those with whom we disagree. This year's topic is a bold step toward understanding the nature of American politics, from the ads that shape us to the candidates we hope will improve our lives. Do we put too much hope in our government? Or too little?

2020 Crosswise summer experience will provide a multi-leveled approach to our voting responsibilities, examining the science behind elections as well as the consequences of a disengaged citizen. For the Christian, the stakes are high and yet there is a tremendous opportunity for the Gospel in the midst of our civic discussions.

Come be a part of the conversation!

Why should my son or daughter attend the Summer Experience at Crosswise?

The short answer is simple. Crosswise is a place where your son or daughter can practice wisdom. Crosswise will model what it means to be in dialogue: we explore how to think deeply, how to engage topics biblically, and how to serve God with our mind. It is our job to provide a rich variety of opportunities to have these important conversations over a five-day span. The topics we talk about aren’t going to have easy answers. In fact, we expect that many of the participants will come to differing conclusions on the presented material.

Why Crosswise? Why your son or daughter?

In case that’s not enough, there’s more:

For $385, your son or daughter receives room, board, program and special activities for 5 days (Sunday evening through Thursday morning).
Participants will have a wide range of learning experiences: Big sessions, small groups, breakout sessions, planned activities, and special events.
Each student will live on campus, getting a taste of collegiate life in a relaxed, but controlled, environment.
Crosswise has sought nationally known presenters who are leaders in their respected fields, as well as established Lutheran theologians to use as conversation partners.
The event will be led from a confessional Lutheran perspective, though we expect a wide variety of denominations represented.
Travel scholarships are available for out-of-state participants. Contact us at crosswise@cui.edu for more information.

Early Rate: $385 until February 1
Regular registration: $489 until June 1

Essentials

Details about our Summer Experience and what to expect during your five-day stay at Concordia University Irvine.

Facilities

Crosswise is strategically located at the Concordia University Campus in Irvine, California.

Concordia’s hilltop setting is located fifty miles south of Los Angeles, eighty miles north of San Diego, and six miles inland from the Pacific Ocean. The beautiful campus is sits atop a spectacular plateau overlooking Orange County.

And because it’s a university campus, all 70 acres of it is designed for students. Modern dorms, gated grounds, convenient food services, athletic fields, a student union, and fabulous meeting spaces. Easy to find, and quick to get to, the private college campus is an ideal setting for engaging the minds of high-schoolers as they come together from diverse locations and backgrounds to give voice to their ideas.

VIEW OUR VIRTUAL TOUR

Chaperones

At Crosswise, local church workers and Concordia students will serve as facilitators, supervisors, and guides during our time together.

Mentoring

Each Crosswise student participates in small group discussions led by a Concordia professor. In addition, the students can experience the academic and communal life of Concordia by attending breakout sessions that advance the theme of the event in the multiple disciplines of the liberal arts. These sessions promote an atmosphere of question-asking, critical thinking, and personal interaction with our professors and staff. Finally, every Crosswise main speaker is made available for individual questions and conversation after his/her presentation to encourage ongoing relationship building.

Activities

Each day we will have a variety of Community Life Activities.  Some of these will happen off campus to nearby places of interest.  Excursions in the past have included a beach trip, a Major League Baseball game and more.  Excursions for this year's Summer Experience will be revealed in the registration confirmation sent a few weeks prior to the event date.

Worship

The themes we explore at Crosswise are always considered through the lens of Scripture. Here, we will cultivate an attitude of worship each day as we exalt our Creator God and refocus our minds on Him.

Getting Ready
Getting Ready for Your Trip
LIABILITY WAIVER and MEDICAL RELEASE FORM

You need to fill it out and have them signed by your parents. You absolutely need to print and bring this with you, and when you arrive we will collect them. If you don’t bring yours, your participation in the week will be seriously limited. If you want to scan and return it by email, that’s great too!

DON’T FORGET A PHOTO ID

You’ll need it to get through airport security. You should allow extra time to get through security at most airports. Allow yourself plenty of time.

DIETARY RESTRICTIONS/SPECIAL NEEDS

We will do our best to accommodate them by knowing this by June 10.

Arriving in Irvine
PLEASE ARRIVE FOR CHECK IN

Arrive for check in at the residence halls (see map buildings #23 & #26). This will also be your pick up spot for Thursday at Noon.

FLYING

If you are flying, you will be arriving at the Orange County Airport (SNA). Please email your arrival information to crosswise@cui.edu. If you do not send us your arrival information, we won’t know when to pick you up! We will make every effort to meet you when you come through the security exit. If we miss you, find the baggage return downstairs, retrieve your bag(s) and look for our Concordia University Irvine students who are in charge of pick up and will be wearing Crosswise shirts and making themselves noticeable.

DRIVING

If you are driving, you will need to check in with the gate attendant when you arrive on campus. You will receive a parking permit (even if you are being dropped off) and will also note where you are allowed to park. Tell them you are here for “Crosswise” and they can show you on the map how to get to the Rho/Sigma dorms for check in.

STUDENTS DRIVING THEMSELVES

Cars left on campus for the week must have a valid parking pass from the attendant and it will be parked through Thursday.

Concordia Irvine is a great place! Students will be housed with three other students in one of our dorm suites - sharing a bathroom. Rooms are equipped with mini fridges and microwaves. Laundry facilities are available for a small fee, bring your own detergent.

WHAT YOU DON’T NEED

What you don’t need is anything in your bag that will jeopardize your attendance with us! You shouldn’t really need personal entertainment devices. If you plan to listen to music to fall asleep, use earbuds to be respectful to your sleeping roommate.

MONEY???

You shouldn’t need much if any. All meals and activities listed on the schedule are provided. Anything additional that you would like while on our off-campus excursions will be at your own expense. Basically, your needs will be met by Crosswise.

TEAM TABLE TALK

You will be in groups of 8-12 throughout the week to unpack the content shared by the plenary speakers in a smaller group led by one of our Concordia University Irvine Christ College professors of Theology.

Crosswise is going to be a great experience! You are going to gather with other youth and adults for an amazing week of fellowship, discussion, fun, worship, spiritual growth and a great time. You will be leading devotions, shooting hoops, swimming, expressing your creativity, and enjoying some great food...AND you are going to meet some of the coolest teenagers from across the country! Be prepared for busy days, late nights and lots of fun.

The Crosswise Team and I are looking forward to welcoming you to Irvine. Take time to check out the website again in the coming days to know our faces before you arrive. We pray for your safe travel and for a great week in Southern California.
