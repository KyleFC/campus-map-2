An endowment funds your passion in perpetuity. The annual investment earnings from the endowment go to support student aid, research initiatives, academic pursuits, technology, student experiences—or other initiatives the investor wishes to support long term. Roughly half of the total raised came through cash gifts while the other half is from estate gifts that will be funded in the future.

We’ve been able to increase our giving over time to make it more and more impactful... We hope our scholarship produces a lifelong appreciation for music and the role it plays in faith.
