The Challenge

Music professionals from across the nation challenge Concordia University Irvine musicians and vocalists to drill-down on One Thing that can make a difference in our craft, our lives, and the lives of our fellow artists.

JOIN THE CONVERSATION #CUIONETHING

Rewrite the Narrative

What if each of us decided to rewrite the narrative, and focus on what we can do during this season?

In the coming weeks, you’ll be invited to participate in the One Thing Challenge. Let’s find the unexpected blessings in the midst of this uncertainty and look forward with hope until we can make music together again!
