Service Areas

College Corps fellows will work with K-12 schools, food banks and pantries, or climate action organizations to invest in the local community and build more equitable solutions and resources for all Californians.

While the College Corps staff will try to place you in your top area of interest, the available positions are determined by community needs, so it’s not guaranteed.
