24-Hour Emergency Number

Your safety and well-being while abroad are of utmost importance to us.

We offer a 24-hour emergency number for students who are in an emergency situation or family members who are concerned about the safety of their students abroad. Your call will be forwarded to the Moon International Center staff on duty.

This number is to be used in cases of emergency only. All other concerns should be directed to our office during regular business hours, from 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. If your call to our emergency number is directed to voicemail, please leave a detailed message with a contact phone number, and your call will be returned. The Moon International Center staff frequently checks for messages.
