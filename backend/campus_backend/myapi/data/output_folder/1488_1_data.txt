We teach that there are three core competencies of worship arts ministry that should be embraced, practiced, and nurtured. We continue to explore these 3 competencies through the Center for Worship Leadership Podcast Network. Our shows are:

On the Ground Floor

Join Matt Preston as he leads conversations with real life ministry leaders as they share the wisdom of their experience in worship leadership. Just as it is important to get a 30k foot view of concepts and ideas, theology and philosophy, it is important to see those ideas lived out as we encourage and lead our local churches. Join us for monthly conversations here on the ground floor. The "On the Ground Floor" podcast is produced by the Center For Worship Leadership, Christ College, Concordia University Irvine, CA.

The Psalm Library

Miikka E. Anttila calls Ephesians 5:19 the “words of institution” of church music that we speak “to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart.” While churches often have many resources to facilitate the singing of hymns and other spiritual songs, Psalm arrangements are often less accessible.

The Center for Worship Leadership Psalm Library provides the church with these settings to continue in this tradition of the people of God engaging in and singing the Psalms as a part of their gatherings. Psalm singing connects us to the ancient church, but even more importantly, to Christ. After all, the Old Testament book Jesus quoted the most was the Psalms!

Psalm 56 (Your Promise)

STREAM THE SONGS

V1

All day long, i’m surrounded
All day long, i am overwhelmed
With the sound of the walls closing in

All day long, You have listened
All day long, You have turned Your ear
To the sound of my hands trembling
So while You’re listening

Chorus

I will praise You
For Your promise
To deliver me from my enemies
I will trust You
In defiance
Of what fear may say, I will not be afraid
For, my God, You’re on my side
And what other hope have I,
Than what You have promised?

V2

All day long, You defend me
All day long, You have caught my tears
So I’ll sing til’ my heart can believe
That my God is for me

Chorus 2

I will praise You
For Your promise
To deliver me from my enemies
I will trust You
In defiance
Of what fear may say, I will not be afraid
For, my God, You’re on my side

Bridge

I will praise you
Before I see the end
Of this story
You have saved me from death
Lord, my feet are secure
As I walk in the light of Your presence

Chorus 1

I will praise You
For Your promise
To deliver me from my enemies
I will trust You
In defiance
Of what fear may say, I will not be afraid
For, my God, You’re on my side
And what other hope have I,
Than what You have promised?

Than what You promised

Psalm 65 (Hope Has an Answer) Radio Edit
By Kip Fox and Mike Middendorf, Copyright 2022
V1

God in Zion, You have heard our prayer
Blessed are your people far and near
All you wounded, weary and alone
Look now our salvation is made known

Chorus

All of the questions that come in the night
All of the hours we pray for the light
Every longing that wakes with the morn
Hope has an answer, the Savior is born

V2

Through him every mountain finds its peak
