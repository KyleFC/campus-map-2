Testimonials

 

“Servant leadership is such a rewarding style of leadership. Throughout this academy, we were reminded that we were all called to serve first as part of being an effective leader. We were reminded how we can encourage and lead people to take action. We focused on how to build teams through effective communication, building trust, and empathy. Servant leadership creates a healthy, positive culture that encourages respect and value for all members while empowering others to grow and become leaders themselves. Thank you, CUI, for allowing me to grow in my own leadership and reminding me how amazing it is to be a servant leader.”
Christine - Crean Lutheran High School

 

“I so appreciated the affirming experiences in this. I felt valued and appreciated in the eyes of those organizing and planning this event and the presenters. I feel more encouraged, motivated, and equipped to perform at a higher level and with greater joy.”
Steve - Orange Unified School District

 

“This conference was the most informative one I’ve been to. The speakers are captivating and touch on topics in education that go unspoken. It is so important to spread these topics to educators all around the world. I hope every educator can attend a conference like the servant leadership one at Concordia.”
Lauryn - Cajon Valley Union School District

 

“What a blessing! Thank you for this incredible opportunity to participate in the Servant Leadership Institute. There were phenomenal speakers and opportunities to network with others. I can’t recommend this enough!”
Natasha - Saddleback Valley Unified School District

 

“The Servant Leadership Institute creates the perfect environment for leaders to learn the important skills to make effective systems within schools. A must for teachers, staff, and administrators. The focus of being a servant leader is so apparent.” 
Doris - Rancho Christian

 

“Being a Christian educator in a public school can feel very lonely. The Educator Leadership Academy provided much-needed mentorship, inspiration, and continual refocus on the vision of serving others. I leave each gathering feeling overwhelming pride to be in the field of education. I never as strongly feel that anywhere other than Concordia.”
Marjie - Newport Mesa Unified School District
 

“My time at the Servant Leadership Institute has positively impacted me personally and professionally. The topics were thought-provoking and engaging. I’m grateful to the entire Concordia University staff for their hospitality and kindness.”
Melissa - Cajon Valley Union School District

 

“The Servant Leadership Institute has been one of the best conferences I have attended.  There was so much thought and care that went into choosing speakers to share practical skills, practices, experiences, and research that applies to everyone in the field of education. There is something for everyone, no matter how much experience you have. It is so refreshing, and I left both sessions inspired, recharged, and wanting to share what I’ve learned.”
Candia - Cajon Valley Union School District
