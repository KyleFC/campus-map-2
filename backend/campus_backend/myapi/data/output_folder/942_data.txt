Grace Alone. Faith Alone.

As an academic community founded on Lutheran beliefs, we are committed to these biblical ideas that shape our life together. Ephesians 2:8 says: "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith — and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God."

We invite our community to be spiritually involved because they truly want to be. This means you have the freedom to come together to express your faith, but as believers in God’s grace, we don’t require you to do so.

At  Concordia University Irvine you will have the freedom, support and opportunity to explore your faith and worship alongside committed Christian faculty and staff members. Our commitment to both grace and faith opens the door to thoughtful dialogue about what it means to follow Christ.

We’re an academic institution. We welcome students of all backgrounds, whether they share our beliefs or are hostile to them. But they’re going to get to know who we are. They’re going to encounter our worldview.

Dr. Steve Mueller, Dean of Christ College
