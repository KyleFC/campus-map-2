n emphasis on lifestyle and lifestyle changes to promote optimal health and longevity. Wellness, however, can be seen as a system of living oriented toward maximizing potential with a focus on self-responsibility. In this approach, one can be intellectually well but physically unwell; one can be socially well but spiritually unwell. These dimensions are not either/or dichotomies as each dimension is a continuum. The emphasis here is viewing the person—or, by extension, the community—as a whole and not only as a body of systems. Courses that explore this question address wellness from multiple dimensions such as spiritual, vocational, physical, emotional, ethical, political, social, and economic wellness.
