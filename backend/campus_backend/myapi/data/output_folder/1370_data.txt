How to Apply 
NATHAN MACGREGOR
Graphic Design Major

What do you hope to do with the skills you've gained at Concordia University IrvineÂ after graduation?

I hope to mix graphic design with mission work/nonprofit work.

What is your favorite thing about Concordia University Irvine?

My favorite thing about CUI is the resources, opportunities and the students. I don't know if I would have any of the same experiences from other universities. CUI has given me the chance to travel outside the US, and challenged me to think broader and deeper and truly discover what my vocation is.
