CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY IRVINE
Give the Gift of Concordia.
Everything we have, God owns.
Everything we need, God supplies.

At Concordia University Irvine, our donors are investors, believers, and dreamers. Your gifts of time, talent, and treasure help us advance the university's mission to develop wise, honorable, and cultivated citizens to serve society and the church. 

Students of Concordia are benefactors of many years of prayerful financial support and thousands of donors each year. It's through our gifted faculty and your generous support that students receive the very best Lutheran Christian college education and go into the world serving God through their callings.

Together, we invest in the lives of our students, empower our faculty, and impact our community - both locally, and beyond our borders into the world. These three priorities are the heartbeat of Concordia.
