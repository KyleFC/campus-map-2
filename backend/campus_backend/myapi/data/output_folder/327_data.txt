Concordia University (CU) Center

The CU Center is where chapel is held and is the performance home for Concordia's music ensembles. Its 500-seat semi-circular auditorium, sweeping vista, and spacious acoustics provide an exciting atmosphere for music concerts and worship. The center boasts a magnificent Casavant organ—one of the finest instruments in Orange County—as well as a grand piano by Steinway.
