ISABELLA JACKSON
Art Major: Studio Art
Graphic Design Minor

What do you hope to do with the skills you've gained at Concordia University Irvine after graduation?

I would love to use my skills and work in a creative environment such as a graphic designer for a clothing brand or an art director.

What are some learning opportunities outside of the classroom?

I’m currently interning at Volcom HQ.
