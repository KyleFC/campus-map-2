AI Use in the Writing Studio

As AI continues to evolve, the Writing Studio’s goals remain the same: to support students’ development as life-long critical learners and clear communicators. As listeners and guides to the writing process, we encourage students to ask questions, solve problems, discover new ideas, and produce their own work.

To that end, the Writing Studio will continue to collaborate with writers, faculty, and other student support services in developing best practices for AI usage. We will also strive to encourage honest, nuanced conversations about AI and find ways to address concerns related to academic honesty.

In each session, we will hold to our promise of student confidentiality and honor the professor’s syllabus and assignment guidelines.
