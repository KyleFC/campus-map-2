A tour of Concordia University Irvine
Location

Enjoying a hilltop setting fifty miles south of Los Angeles, eighty miles north of San Diego, and six miles inland from the Pacific Ocean, Concordia University is located on a spectacular 70-acre plateau overlooking Orange County.

The city of Irvine is a planned community, primarily residential but including multi-national business and industrial complexes. It is rated one of the safest cities of its size in the United States. The surroundings of the Concordia campus offer an oasis to wildlife and are an ideal setting for the newest of the LCMS universities. Can't make it to our campus? Check out our virtual tour.
