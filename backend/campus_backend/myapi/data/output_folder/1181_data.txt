CONCORDIA serves

On this service day at KidWorks, students will support two major projects.

During the Preschool sessions, volunteers will assist their preschool team in their work. Volunteers will clean and organize the classroom storage area as well as help with the preschool students there.

Additionally, volunteers will help by creating their yearly Trunk-or-Treat decorations. This will entail creating Halloween decorations, such as painted banners, photo props, and booth signs.

 Tuesday, September 26, 2023, 9:15am - 12:30pm
