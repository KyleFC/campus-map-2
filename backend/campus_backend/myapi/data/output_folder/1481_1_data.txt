Give yourself time to adapt to the cultural differences. You may even find that many of the differences are a pleasant change from the way of life in the U.S. Taking an active interest in finding meanings and values behind unfamiliar customs expands your horizons and adds the wealth of another culture to your experience and knowledge.

How Cultural Differences Relate to You

Discovering cultural differences and experiencing "culture shock" are both powerful learning tools. You gain a high degree of self-understanding and develop as a person. By studying abroad, you get an excellent education on what it means to be a U.S. citizen and also how the rest of the world lives and thinks.

Don't try to find a "little United States" wherever you go; minimize your comparisons with home. If you constantly use America as a base for your thoughts, you will miss so many of the beautiful experiences your host country has to offer.

There will be difficult and even frustrating times, but bad moments (even days) are quickly forgotten with time and patience. When you return, you'll realize that even the bad experiences are priceless.
