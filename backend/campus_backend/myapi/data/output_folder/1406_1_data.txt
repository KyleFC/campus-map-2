mpleting a graduate degree is considered an honor.

Decorum Policies
Doctoral regalia, including the length and style, may not be altered. Hoods and tams may not be customized in any way.
Only CUI-approved regalia (including pins, stoles, cords, and medallions) bestowed at the Undergraduate Academic Achievement ceremony and provided by university-sponsored clubs or CUI Veterans Resource Center may be worn at graduation. Decorative items such as costume leis, beads, or sashes may only be worn after the ceremony.
Federal Loan Exit Counseling

If you have borrowed money under the Stafford Loan program, federal regulations require you to complete Loan Exit Counseling before graduating. The Financial Aid Office has arranged for you to complete the session online at www.cui.edu/loans. If you have questions, contact Financial Aid at 949-214-3066.
