f the total scheduled financial assistance earned. The portion of federal loans and grants the student is entitled to earn is calculated on a percentage basis by comparing the total number of calendar days in the semester to the number of days completed before total withdrawal. The total withdrawal date for calculating the Return of Title IV financial assistance will be determined by the University as the date the student officially withdraws per the institutional procedures.

It is the student's responsibility to immediately notify the Registrar's Office that they are withdrawing. The Office of the Registrar is located on the 1st floor of the Grimm Hall Building. They may be reached at 949-214-3079.

Questions about the Title IV refund amounts should be directed to your financial aid office at finaid@cui.edu or by calling 949-214-3066.

Title IV Federal Funds: Tuition, Fees, Room and Board

Tuition and Fees: Through Title IV, the University takes the responsibility on behalf of the student to credit the student's account with federal funds to satisfy current charges for tuition and fees.
Room and Board: Through Title IV, excess federal funds creating a credit balance after tuition and fees are paid in full can be used to pay for room and board charges. The student is immediately responsible for the entire outstanding balance that is not covered by financial assistance.

Any credit balances created by disbursements of Title IV funds on the student's account must be paid by the University directly to the student or parent borrower as soon as possible, but no later than 14 days after one of the following as agreed to on the Bursar's Office Budgetary Agreement Form:

The beginning of the semester
After loan disbursement causing a credit balance
The date the school received notice from the student or parent borrower to cancel his or her authorization on a Bursar's Office Budgetary Agreement Form to have the school manage a credit balance
Withdrawal Tuition Charges and Refunds Due to Dropped Courses

Students withdrawing from the university or dropping courses within the refund period may be eligible for a refund of charges in accordance with the University's fee schedule and refund procedures. Students who withdraw from school after classes begin may inquire about a refund (i.e., tuition, room, board) by contacting the Bursar's Office. Class fees, new student orientation fee are not refundable. Student service fee is not refundable after the census date.

The student is responsible for paying any outstanding charges to the University. Dropping courses or withdrawing from the university may or may not result in a credit on the student's account. Please contact the Bursar's Office for further information.
