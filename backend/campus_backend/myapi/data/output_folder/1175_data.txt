CONCORDIA serves

Do you have a heart for coloring or sharing words of encouragement? This is a great volunteer opportunity for all ages and groups! Whether youâ€™re an expert artist, or just love to color kind messages. We would love to send you instructions on how to decorate cards you can send to us so that we can deliver them to encourage brave kids fighting cancer.
