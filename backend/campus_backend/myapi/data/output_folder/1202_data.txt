CAMPUS MINISTRY
SHAPE

You have been baptized into the Body of Christ, and God desires for you now to use your spiritual gifts to build up the church. We ask that all of our students leading any ministry to go through a SHAPE analysis. What is SHAPE?

S - Spiritual Gifts
H - Heart
A - Abilities
P - Personality
E - Experience

The SHAPE exercise will take you about 90 minutes to complete. Let us help you get into SHAPE!
