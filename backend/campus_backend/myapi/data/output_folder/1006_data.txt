Parking on Campus during Orientation

All students will be directed to park in the Grimm Hall parking lot and the parking lot near the baseball field for Orientation Check-in. Once on-campus students have successfully gone through Orientation Check-in, they will be directed to the Front Lot to park near the residence halls. To ensure every on-campus student has close access to the residence halls when moving in, it is required for cars to be moved to the Front Lot parking after students have successfully moved in. Parents returning to CUI for other events throughout the weekend can park in the Grimm Hall parking lot.
