Phi Delta Epsilon

Phi Delta Epsilon is an international, coeducational, medical fraternity that offers its members experienced guidance from the pre-medical level through medical school and beyond. We have over 30,000 active members in the United States alone and that number is continually expanding. Our presence on the Concordia University, Irvine campus greatly benefits the population of Pre-Health students here by setting an example of excellence in academics, philanthropy, and service through sponsored events such as distinguished lectureships, volunteer opportunities through our partner Children's Hospital Orange County (CHOC), help with Habitat for Humanity, and much more. With "facta non verba, deeds not words" as our guiding motto, we here at Concordia are making an impact.
