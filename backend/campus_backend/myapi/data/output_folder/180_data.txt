Q&I Explained

Concordia is among a distinctive group of universities that offer a coherent liberal arts curriculum for all of its students. Rather than asking you to cobble together a meaningful general education experience from a vast array of disconnected distribution courses, our signature curriculum Enduring Questions & Ideas (Q&I, for short) is carefully crafted so that you discover the purpose of a liberal arts education - to grow intellectually, ethically, and spiritually. Through Q&I Core and Exploration courses, all Concordia students engage in an academic experience that provides a foundation for further learning and for life.

Concordia University Irvine is a member of the Association for Core Texts and Courses. This prestigious association "is dedicated to the use of core texts, that is, world classics, in commonly-taken, undergraduate, liberal arts courses."  Instead of reading textbooks about great ideas, you will read the primary sources in a variety of disciplines, allowing you to "play along" with the great thinkers and artists of the past.

Why Q&I?

We believe Q&I is among the most distinctive undergraduate curriculums in the nation. Recent data from our students and alumni shows the impact it's having – in the classroom and the workplace.

Q&I Core Courses

Q&I Core is comprised of classic liberal arts courses offered in small, innovative learning communities. Q&I Core courses are taken together in linked pairs: biology with theology, mathematics with philosophy, and history with literature. For transfer students, we offer a unique pair: philosophy with theology. Q&I Core classes typically have just 25 students, giving you a close-knit learning community.

Concordia's Q&I Core classes are mostly taught by full-time professors. Interaction with the professors is not limited to the classroom setting either. You are encouraged to meet with your professors during office hours. In fact, Q&I Core classes typically offer tutorials where you meet with your professors individually to discuss your papers and develop your ideas.

What are Truth, Goodness, & Beauty?
Math & Philosophy

Philosophers and mathematicians in ancient Greece found themselves wondering about some of the same questions. “What is truth?” How can I identify something that is certain, valid, and complete, and must I cultivate certain virtues to find it? “What is beauty?” What are the objective attributes that identify beauty and why do some objects look beautiful while others do not? “What is good?” What and where is goodness in the world, and why should I pursue it? The Core Mathematics 101 and Core Philosophy 101 courses engage students in these same questions by examining great works and ideas. Students will come to see the individual and social significance of these questions in our own day, and they will be challenged to read carefully, think rigorously, and write well in order to develop reasoned answers to them.

What is Truth?
Biology & Theology

People have asked this question since they have been able to speak to one another. It confronts the intellectual struggles humans have had with the idea of reality. Answering simply that truth is “what is right or factual” or “what is not false” are often posited; but when answers such as this are thought about in any depth, they are found wanting. This is why we ask this question in Core Biology 101 and Core Theology 101. It helps students realize that, while the sciences and religion set forth strong claims about the objectivity of the truth, no claim to truth is absolutely neutral, objective, or without the influence of a culture or intellectual paradigm. We can change our minds. We can evaluate our cultures and paradigms. But this takes dedication to a broad and deep conversation across disciplines. The question “What Is Truth?” puts students on a path toward the realization that truth without culture is not possible in human society. It encourages us to critically evaluate our biases, and to challenge the idea that there is a completely neutral, secular vantage point from which an observer might investigate the world. Finally, it allows us to understand the truth of this life’s experiences in light of the Truth incarnate: the person of Jesus Christ.

Co-requisite: CBIO 101; permission from Academic Advising is needed to take CTHL 101 as an unlinked course.
Choose one of the following:
What is Freedom?
History & Literature

Freedom is difficult to define. In fact, it is usually defined negatively, that is, by the absence of certain things like coercion, slavery, imprisonment, and tyranny. And as difficult as it is to define, freedom is even more challenging to implement. It is always conditional and limited because it can actually conflict with other features of a good society, such as security, order, justice, or equality. At what point, then, do the conditions and limitations on freedom actually destroy it? To what extent should we sacrifice other good features like security or equality for the sake of freedom? The Core English 202 and Core History 202 courses seek to make sense of the modern world by engaging with great works of literature and political philosophy from the last four centuries as they grapple with these and other problems posed by the quest for freedom.

Q&I Core Courses for Transfer Students

A unique pairing of philosophy and theology Core courses has been designed for students transferring with 30 or more semester units. They will explore the question of what it means to be human.

What Does It Mean to be Human?

What is the common human condition? Can a human being know anything about God with certainty? Do we have souls? How about free will? What does it mean for a human being to be the object of redemption by an infinitely merciful Savior? How should a human being live and why? Which virtues, if any, are important in human life? Answers to these and similar questions have enormous consequences for individuals and society. Core Theology 200 and Core Philosophy 200 help students develop reasoned answers to questions such as these by engaging the Scriptures and classic texts to examine what it means to be human.

Throughout Q&I, you will wrestle with life's foundational questions and ideas. You will be challenged to read great works closely, think critically and creatively about problems, communicate your ideas effectively in writing and speech, and make meaningful connections between academic disciplines, the Christian faith, and life. By developing your knowledge and strengthening your intellectual habits, you will become broadly prepared for life and further studies. You will develop into a wise, honorable, and cultivated citizen who can tackle life's challenges and use your gifts to serve society and the church.

“Who Do You Say That I Am?”

The biggest questions that people ask are spiritual questions. Who am I? Is this all that there is? Where did I come from? Where am I going? Is there such a thing as truth? Are all religions the same? Is God knowable? How can we know (about) God? Jesus asked his disciples the most important question: “Who do you say that I am?” (Mark 8:29). This question about Jesus—and all he taught, did, claimed to be, and the impact he had/has on life—still echoes in our ears expecting an answer. Courses that explore this critical question (and others related to it) examine God's self-revelation, and consider people's reception of it and their response to it.

How Shall I Live?

How shall I live well? Health can be defined as a state of being indicating signs and symptoms of disease or lack of disease. As such there is an emphasis on lifestyle and lifestyle changes to promote optimal health and longevity. Wellness, however, can be seen as a system of living oriented toward maximizing potential with a focus on self-responsibility. In this approach, one can be intellectually well but physically unwell; one can be socially well but spiritually unwell. These dimensions are not either/or dichotomies as each dimension is a continuum. The emphasis here is viewing the person—or, by extension, the community—as a whole and not only as a body of systems. Courses that explore this question address wellness from multiple dimensions such as spiritual, vocational, physical, emotional, ethical, political, social, and economic wellness.

Why Art?

The Arts—visual art, theatre, music, and others—have several purposes. Art can entertain, be profane, or be profound. Art can also move people to significant historical actions, to personal peace or angst, or to community or conflict. A cultivated citizen is capable of engaging with various art forms to reflect and to affect society, an inner sense of being, personal relations, and faith expressions. Courses that explore Art engage students with the Arts and pursue questions such as: What is art? How is art good or useful? What role does art play in shaping and/or reflecting culture? What role does our aesthetic response play in understanding art? How do creativity and the creative process relate to your vocation(s)? How does a Christian responsibly experience or participate in art? How does the beauty and ugliness of art help us to understand God’s Law and Gospel?

How Do I Understand Nature?

Modern society uses the natural sciences to make sense of the universe, understand how it operates, and help us understand our place in it. A “wise, honorable, and cultivated citizen” needs to be aware of worldview and how it affects one’s view of the natural (and the supernatural) world. To ponder all that is real, one must ask and answer hard questions that continue to vex us, questions such as: What is truth? What is science? How do faith and science relate? Can I know the reality of God like the reality of the atom? How should humanity interact with nature? Courses that explore these (and other related) questions will help students know why they believe what they know about nature and how to articulate their thoughts in an educated manner.

Reforming General Education

Our Q&I curriculum recently received national recognition in a 2018 report by The Chronicle of Higher Education, a premiere publication for academic affairs among colleges and universities. As one of only three institutional profiles in the report, Q&I was highlighted for the way we have refreshed our general-education courses by focusing on timeless questions and great texts. The results have been significant – not only in increased intellectual habits but in soaring student engagement.
