We encourage undergraduates at Concordia to join the competition! This is an amazing opportunity for growth and experience in the business world, and it is a fun way to make connections and win a prize! All majors are welcome as well. You do not have to be a Business major to join the competition. This competition is meant to help students gain public speaking experience in front of professionals and audiences, stem the creativity and ideas of potential business plans, build connections, and have fun!

There will also be workshops included before the competition to help students develop their plans!

The Mixer/Social Night (Fast Pitch Competition) is April 05th, 2024 at 5:00 PM

The Competition Day is on April 06th, 2024 at 9:00 AM
