Lutheran Teacher Certificate
Dr. Cari Chittick, Director of Lutheran Teaching Ministry

Through Christ College, Concordia University Irvine Lutheran Teacher programs prepare the student for teaching in Lutheran schools at either the primary or secondary level. Students in Lutheran teaching programs complete the requirements for a California teaching credential (either for High School, Jr. High or elementary school teaching) and Christ College requirements. Students teaching assignments will include both public school settings and Lutheran schools. These students will then be certified, called and commissioned by The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod to teach in Lutheran schools and hold a Lutheran Teacher Certificate.
