TITLE IX
Reporting Procedures

Please remember that Concordia University Irvine requires all faculty or staff who have responsibility for student welfare to promptly report information about any incident of sexual misconduct or relationship violence as provided below unless the employee is required by law to keep that information confidential by virtue of his or her professional role. In addition, those employees who have been informed by the Department of Campus Safety that they are “Campus Security Authorities” under the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act are legally required to report such incidents to the Department of Campus Safety.

If you feel that a student may disclose any information to you that he or she would like to keep confidential, make every effort to ensure that he or she understands the following:

You are obligated to report the incident to the Title IX Coordinator who will begin an investigation
All reports made to the Title IX Coordinator will be kept private. Information will only be shared with those individuals who have a legitimate need to know the information in order to assist in the response to, investigation, and/or resolution of the complaint.
The student can speak confidentially to The Wellness Center, Campus Pastor, as well as off-campus crisis centers and hotlines.
