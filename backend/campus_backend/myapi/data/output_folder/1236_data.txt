What is Eagles Gmail?

Your Eagles Gmail is a web-based email system that we will use to communicate with you. Financial Aid, the Registrar, Academic Advising, and the other areas on campus will all use this as a primary means of communicating information to you. Please check it regularly. If you wish to, you may set a forwarding email address in your Eagles Gmail so that email can be sent to another email address of your choosing.

How do you log in?

Use your Student ID as your "Username" to log in and the same password that you use for Blackboard and the library databases.

What if you cannot log in?

If you are having problems logging in to Eagles Gmail, make sure you have activated your account on the self-service password management website. You will NOT be able to use your temporary password to log in to any Concordia online resource. You must activate in the self-service site and change your password first. If you have already activated your account, go to the self-service password management website and try resetting your password using the instructions on the website.

If this still does not work, contact IT Services via email: ITS@cui.edu or call 949.214.3175.
