OFFICE OF RESIDENCE LIFE
Chi Rho

Chi Rho is a suite-style residence hall, which has been set aside as a freshmen only building. A student's freshman year is an opportunity to grow and develop in many different aspects of their lives. By having all of our freshmen housing together, there is an opportunity for many of the new students to make friends and to develop relationships, which they will carry with them throughout the duration of their academic stay at Concordia.
