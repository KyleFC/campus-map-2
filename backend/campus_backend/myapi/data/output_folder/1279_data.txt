CUI PAYROLL DEDUCTION
Giving at Concordia University Irvine

Regardless of the amount, your support helps bolster key college initiatives and illustrates that those who know Concordia best support the university with their time, talents, and treasures.

Please prayerfully consider a gift or payroll deduction to help support the students, programs, and people you see every day. You can earmark your contribution for a specific department or program, a scholarship, or the Concordia Fund which directs resources to the areas with the greatest need. Your gift makes an impact.

Contact David Fahey at 949-214-3182 or david.fahey1@cui.edu, or stop by Alpha 209 with any questions.
