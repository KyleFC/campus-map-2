ABBEY WEST
Student Leadership
abbey west

abbey west is a movement of students on the campus of Concordia University Irvine who want to shed worn-out perceptions of what Christianity is all about. Returning again to the teachings of Jesus, our mission is quite simply to make disciples of a new generation.
