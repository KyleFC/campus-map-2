A former player and coach at NCAA Div. I powerhouse Cal State Fullerton, Joe Turgeon was named head coach of the Concordia University Irvine baseball team in July of 2015 after serving seven seasons as the program's top assistant coach.

He enters the 2022 season with 126 total victories at Concordia and secured career win No. 100 when the Eagles topped Holy Names at home in February of 2020.

During the 2021 season, Turgeon and his staff navigated strict COVID-19 protocols and led the Eagles to a 21-15 record and a second-place finish in the Southern California pod of the PacWest Conference. Senior shortstop Haloa Dudoit finished his career as the CUI career hits leader during the final month of the season and his roommate Bailey Collins also tied the school record for career home runs, finishing with 35 as an Eagle. Senior Day was also a great memory for the 19 graduating Eagles as four different seniors homered in their final doubleheader wearing the CUI uniform in a pair of wins over Fresno Pacific. The Eagles got hot down the stretch and won 10 of their final 13 games and just missed making the NCAA DII West Regional Tournament for the first time in program history.

Under his leadership, the Eagles earned their first-ever national ranking by the National College Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) when they were listed No. 23 in the Top 25 NCAA DII poll. At the time the 2020 season was abruptly ended due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Turgeon's squad had raced out to a 17-7 overall record with a 6-2 mark in PacWest play. The Eagles also sported an impressive 14-3 home record playing in the friendly confines of newly renovated Eagles Field. Over the course of just two months, CUI's Bailey Collins, Matt Lautz and Cooper Moore all earned PacWest Player of the Week nods and Shane Schick and Derek Delgado combined for three PacWest Freshman of the Week Awards.

2019 was also a strong year for the CUI baseball team as the Eagles went 18-14 in conference and finished fourth after sweeping Holy Names to close out the season. Six Eagles were recognized on the All-PacWest Conference Teams with shortstop Haloa Dudoit also garnering PacWest Defensive Player of the Year, while designated hitter Cooper Moore was named to the All-Region Second Team by the D2CCA, ABCA and NCBWA.

In 2018, the baseball squad had an overall record of 22-28 and went 19-21 in conference.

In 2017, he led the Eagles to 22 wins with three All-PacWest selections. Ryan Land was named CoSIDA Academic All-Region and received the Concordia Athletics Academic Achievement Award. The previous year, the team won 21 games in the PacWest and also had three All-PacWest selections. During the 2018 campaign, the Eagles won 22 games and sophomore shortstop Haloa Dudoit was named All-PacWest.

Prior to joining the Concordia coaching staff, Turgeon spent the 2007 and 2008 campaigns as an assistant for Cal State Fullerton head coaches George Horton and Dave Serrano. Turgeon also spent the summer of 2007 as a pitching coach for the Texas Collegiate League's Duncanville Deputies.

Turgeon played five years (including one as a redshirt) as an outfielder for the Cal State Fullerton Titans, who captured the NCAA
