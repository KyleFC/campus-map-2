Why Art?

The Arts—visual art, theatre, music, and others—have several purposes. Art can entertain, be profane, or be profound. Art can also move people to significant historical actions, to personal peace or angst, or to community or conflict. A cultivated citizen is capable of engaging with various art forms to reflect and to affect society, an inner sense of being, personal relations, and faith expressions. Courses that explore Art engage students with the Arts and pursue questions such as: What is art? How is art good or useful? What role does art play in shaping and/or reflecting culture? What role does our aesthetic response play in understanding art? How do creativity and the creative process relate to your vocation(s)? How does a Christian responsibly experience or participate in art? How does the beauty and ugliness of art help us to understand God’s Law and Gospel?
