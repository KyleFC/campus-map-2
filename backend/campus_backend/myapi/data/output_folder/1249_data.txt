Title IX Complaint Form
TITLE IX

To file a complaint with the University, please complete this online form which will be submitted electronically to the Title IX Coordinator. You do not have to complete all of the questions, but we ask you to answer them to the best of your ability. You can also call the Office of Student Conduct to make arrangements for a representative to meet with you in person to make a verbal complaint.

Although the University cannot commit to keeping a complaint of discrimination confidential because of the University’s obligation to investigate the complaint, the University will use its best efforts not to disseminate information concerning the complaint beyond those who have a need to know. Please feel free to contact our office if you have any questions regarding the process for filing or investigating complaints of discrimination, including sexual harassment.
