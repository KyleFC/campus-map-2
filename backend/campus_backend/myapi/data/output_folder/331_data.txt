ASCUI Executive Board
STUDENT LEADERSHIP
Mission Statement

The Associated Students of Concordia University Irvine (ASCUI), guided by the Great Commission of Jesus Christ, exists to express the student voice to the administration in the realms of student affairs, policies, and administrative decisions.

Core Value Statement

The Executive Board of ASCUI aims to serve the student body through advocacy to higher Administration. We will work interdependently with other departments on campus to holistically serve the students. With accountability, our goal is to develop wise, honorable, and cultivated citizens through all student leaders with dedication and integrity.

Events
Open Forum

Open forum is a time for students to openly share comments, concerns, and suggestions with the upper administration on our campus!

I Heart CUI Day

I Heart CUI Day is our annual appreciation day for Concordia’s campus, students, and staff! Free T-shirts are handed out, and Concordia’s famous turkey burgers are served in the Student Union dining hall by our staff and faculty.

Concordia Christmas

Concordia Christmas is Concordia’s annual Christmas festival with a different theme each year. Students, families, faculty, and staff are all invited to end the fall semester with Christmas-themed games, food, and fun!
