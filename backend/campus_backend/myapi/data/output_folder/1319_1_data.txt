Faculty Spotlights

We will continue to make available faculty bios for every professor who teaches in our undergraduate programs. However, knowing that there is variation in the amount of information that faculty members provide, we also can highlight certain faculty members in the form of a Faculty Spotlights section. These might be faculty members who have recent accomplishments that we want to draw special attention to or a story we can tell on the website.
