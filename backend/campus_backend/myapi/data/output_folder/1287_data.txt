YOUNG ALUMNI GOLD

Graduates of the Last Decade (GOLD) Alumni comprise nearly 60% of our active Alumni body. One-time or recurring gifts from our young Alumni are recognized through GOLDen member benefits.

Benefits of Membership
Reduced rates at the Eagle Golf Classic
Reduced rates for the Gala of Stars
Donors who give $500 or more are automatically members of the PACESETTERS and enjoy the benefits of that society.
Here’s why your support is essential:

Leadership: Your participation identifies you as a leader amongst your peers – and greater alumni participation increases value to your degree.

Philanthropy: With a gift to the University, you play a vital role in ensuring that current and future students have the same opportunities you did.

Commitment: Your annual support allows the University to continue to attract and retain the best faculty, support student academic and extracurricular programs, and maintain its role as a leading Christian institution.
