Purpose
Increase access to SOE graduate programs for Hispanic and low-income students by promoting programs to undergraduate and master’s level students and offering financial assistance.
Creation of the Vocación Graduate Resource Center (GRC) for multi-tiered support. The center will coordinate and systematize the support efforts provided by the SOE into a cohesive space for student persistence measures. The GRC will be a central location for academic advising/success coaching, writing support, networking, and access to services like health & wellness, and counseling for Master’s and Ed.D. students.
Initiation of a formalized faculty-student mentoring program in the Ed.D. program to ensure that all student populations receive equal access to faculty mentors.
Degree redesign that provides a pathway from master’s level to doctoral level programs and adds a practicum component for the doctoral level.
Professional Development for all graduate level faculty and course developers in the SOE who will be trained on specifically designed academic instruction in English (SDAIE) and asset-based mindset strategies.
Improve “belonging” for Hispanic students by making a more welcoming and inclusive community in the SOE.
Increase enrollment and graduation rates of Hispanic students.
