Theatre at Concordia

The show can’t go on without design and technical production! Behind the scenes, experts in stage design, lighting, sound, and production are needed for a performance to be a success. Theatre majors who choose the design and technical production emphasis will study theatrical design, costume design, period styles of design, and the design of lighting and sound for stage productions.

Students will be trained to work in professional theatre. However, the knowledge of design principles, historical research, lighting and sound, and artistic skills gained from an emphasis in Theatre Design and Technical Production forms a valuable career foundation for multiple career options.

With a degree in Theatre: Design and Technical Production, you will be provided with the skills necessary to work in a variety of careers, such as:

Lighting technician
Stage technician
Community arts promotion
Arts education
