side to burn what you ate and help make a water drainage system. This lasted three more hours under the hot sun and under extreme but bearable humid conditions.

After work, you were super famished and exhausted. When you got to the restaurant to have dinner, no one had trouble taking off their shoes and sitting on the floor. The dinners were filling and a nice reward after a long day.

You admit that the biggest reward of the day was definitely getting to lay on the "hard as rock bed" with a mosquito net surrounding the entire bed.

The net created a cave that would keep you and your roommate safe from the spiders and from being eaten alive by the mosquitoes. The room was a little small and only had cold water, a fan and air conditioning, which broke the last two days.

Besides those imperfections you encountered every night and ended up forgetting they even existed, the room did the job at providing a place to come back to and rest after a super long, hard day.
