LUTHERAN TEACHING MINISTRY PROGRAM
Christ College
Emma Mathes '24
Lutheran Teaching
(Elementary and Secondary Education)
Get Equipped to Teach in Lutheran K-12 Schools

While the majority of classes in the program are in education and specific academic content areas, Lutheran teachers are also equipped as teachers of the faith who serve their students not only academically but spiritually. They work within a team ministry environment, exploring the interaction of faith and learning, and truly caring for their students. Those who have a heart for Jesus and a passion for teaching ministry are guided to serve God by being servant leaders in their classrooms, at the congregational level, and beyond.
