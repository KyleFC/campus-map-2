How to Apply 
Scholarship/Portfolio

The Art Department at Concordia University Irvine offers scholarship opportunities to students who show strong promise in studio art and graphic design. Scholarship amounts are determined by portfolio. Applicants must declare a studio art or graphic design major in order to receive scholarship funds.

Scholarship funds are limited and thus the application process is competitive. Students are encouraged to apply early.

Typical awards range from $2,000 - $3,000.

Deadline extended to April 3, 2024.

Portfolio

The portfolio should include 10 images (jpeg or pdf). Portfolio artwork may include drawings, painting, photography, ceramics, digital works, mixed media, printmaking, sculptures, etc. Portfolios may include coursework or artwork created outside of art courses, preferably within the past two years.

Requirements to Maintain Your Scholarship

Once a scholarship has been earned, the only requirements to continue earning the scholarship funds each year at Concordia are:

The student must enroll in one 3 credit hour course in art/graphic design each year.
Maintain an Art/Graphic Design minor if they choose to change majors.
The student must maintain a 2.5 grade point average.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Prof. Rachel Soo at (949) 214-3289.
