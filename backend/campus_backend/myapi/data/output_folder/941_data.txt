Don't Ask: "Is God Calling Me to Serve?"
Ask: "How Is God Calling Me to Serve?"

Jesus commissioned his church to make disciples of all nations. From its founding, Concordia University Irvine’s Christ College has equipped students to carry out that Great Commission, inviting students to live out their faith with thankful hearts, eager to share the Gospel with others.

Serving Christ and his people through called ministry deserves the best preparation possible. Our approach to ministry preparation reflects Southern California’s culturally diverse setting. You will encounter a rich variety of cultures in area congregations and through local and global mission opportunities. You will experience ministry hands on as you engage in your studies. As you prepare to bring Christ to the nations, where better to study than where Christ has brought the nations to you?

Every step of the way, our excellent faculty members are there to mentor you. They are all actively involved in ministry today, bringing practical experiences in called ministry to the classroom. All of our theology faculty members have advanced academic degrees and have published in their field. The personal relationship you will have with these professors, as they bring academics and application together, will equip you for ministry.
