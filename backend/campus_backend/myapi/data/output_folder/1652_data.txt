Virtually everyone supports religious liberty, and virtually everyone opposes discrimination. But how do we handle the hard questions that arise when these two priorities seem to conflict? How do we promote the common good while respecting conscience in a diverse society?

Speakers John Corvino, a longtime LGBT-rights advocate, and prominent social conservative Ryan Anderson debate these issues with civility, clarity, and flair. Their debate is an essential contribution to contemporary discussions about why religious liberty matters and what respecting it requires.

This event is free and open to the public, but space is limited. Pre-registration for this afternoon's event is now closed. However, walk-ins are welcome to attend. We look forward to seeing you there.

This University Convocation is presented by the Department of History & Political Thought and the School of Arts & Sciences at Concordia University Irvine.
