thletes will continue in accordance with NCAA guidelines. All students and employees can request a COVID-19 test at any time through the Wellness Center. Close contacts of infected individuals will also be tested. As a reminder, anyone who has symptoms of illness, even minor symptoms, should not go to class or to work, but should stay home and consult with a health professional before returning to normal activities. Students are encouraged to use #CampusClear for daily symptom monitoring.

COVID-19 Dashboard and Resources

Concordia’s campus COVID-19 cases are regularly updated on CUI’s COVID-19 Dashboard. The Dashboard website also lists information about vaccine resources, symptom checking, and testing.

We will continue to closely monitor both campus and local COVID-19 infection rates. We are also in regular communication with the OCHCA about our COVID-19 case numbers. Campus guidance for masks, testing, and other health measures will be evaluated on a weekly basis, and any changes will be communicated to the campus community in a timely manner.

Campus Update: Indoor Mask Guidelines Extended

October 1, 2021

Greetings to our CUI Students, Families and Employees!

As we near the midpoint of the fall semester, it has been heartening to see activities resume on campus. Students, families, and employees repeatedly communicate how thankful they are for the opportunities they have to interact with each other, resume more “normal” activities, and meet in person with classmates and professors.

Update to Mask Guidelines on Campus

In the latter half of September, our campus community has continued to see a steady number of positive COVID-19 cases, mostly attributed to specific group settings outside the classroom.

In order to keep up progress toward bringing transmission rates lower, current campus mask guidance will be extended through October 15, 2021. All employees, students, and campus guests, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, are to continue to wear face coverings in all indoor campus settings.

Concordia’s decision to extend indoor mask requirements reflects our commitment to providing a safe and comfortable environment for all our students, employees, and guests. Asking all members of the community to wear masks indoors helps alleviate feelings of being “singled out” for wearing a mask. It also offers protection for members of our community who, for personal or health reasons, are not vaccinated. We demonstrate love for our neighbors when we show concern and respect for the well being of all.

As a reminder, there are limited exceptions to the mask guidelines. Resident students are not required to wear a mask within the student’s residence hall room. No student will be required to wear a mask for athletics practices, or co-curricular activities such as instrumental and vocal ensemble rehearsals, forensics rehearsals, theatre rehearsals, etc. Faculty who are fully vaccinated will not be required to wear a mask while teaching in the front of the classroom. Students who are fully vaccinated may remove their masks while presenting in front of the class. Masks may be removed when eating in the cafeteria and Eagles’ Landing, but should be on while going through line or returning to the serving areas.

COVID-19 Dashboard and Resources

Concordia’s campus COVID-19 cases are regularly updated on CUI’s COVID-19 Dashboard. The Dashboard website also lists information about vaccine resources, symptom checking, and testing.

Our campus community continues to emphasize loving our neighbor in all our actions and decisions, including the health guidelines in place for the safety and reassurance of all our community members. We are also in regular communication with the Orange County Health Care Agency about our COVID-19 case numbers, and we continue to monitor local infection rates in Orange County.The indoor campus mask mandate will be reevaluated prior to October 15, 2021.

Campus Update: Indoor Mask Guidelines Extended

September 16, 2021

Greetings to our CUI Students and Employees!

Update to Mask Guidelines on Campus

Our campus community has continued to see a low, but steady number of positive COVID-19 cases since the Labor Day holiday weekend. There is also a steady but slow trend downward in cases in Orange County. If our campus and county infection numbers continue to trend downward, we are optimistic that indoor mask requirements can be relaxed by early October.

In order to keep up progress toward bringing transmission rates lower, current campus mask guidance will be extended through October 1, 2021. All employees, students, and campus guests, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, are to continue to wear face coverings in all indoor campus settings.
