Men's Chorus

Dr. Clarissa Shan, director

The Concordia Men’s Chorus is an energized group of men who love to sing and perform distinctive music for men’s voices. Through the rehearsal of sacred and secular music representing a broad range of styles, singers strive for a high standard of vocal excellence. Performances include fall and spring concerts, Christmas performances, the popular Valentine’s Concert, and annual tours. The Men’s Chorus also regularly sings for chapel services on campus and in worship at area churches and schools. The ensemble is open to all undergraduate men by audition. The ensemble rehearses Tuesdays and Thursdays, 5:10-6:30 PM.
