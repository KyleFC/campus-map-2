PACESETTERS
Honoring Donors who share our vision.
Making a Difference in the Lives of Students

Pacesetters, Concordia University’s leadership giving society, are people who have caught the vision of Concordia University as a place where strong academic programs, outstanding faculty and staff and state-of-the art facilities contribute to the spiritual, moral and professional development of our students and future leaders.

Pacesetters set the pace in advancing the mission of Concordia University. Through their prayers and gifts, they become personally involved in educating young people who will witness to their faith in a variety of vocations. By example, Pacesetters encourage others to follow their lead in supporting this Great Commission University.

Please prayerfully consider becoming a Pacesetter in Concordia’s mission. Gifts support student scholarships, academic programs, or other projects on campus. Listed below are the benefits for each level of giving:
