MASTER OF ARTS IN EDUCATION: SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY
Curriculum

The M.A.Ed in School Psychology with Pupil Personnel Services (PPS) Credential requires a minimum of 60 units. Coursework focuses on the skills you need to work as a school psychologist in diverse school settings, teaching you how to coordinate appropriate interventions and conduct evaluations for students of concern and/or students with disabilities. You’ll also engage in concurrent fieldwork to give you vital, hands-on experience at school.  

The program is offered in both blended and fully online formats. Each term, cohorts will complete one course every eight weeks. If you choose the blended option, you’ll meet on our Irvine campus. Online students will attend synchronously.

These classes take place once a week, every other week, from 6:00-7:30 p.m. The other four weeks of the term (weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8), you’ll work online asynchronously. Through an online learning management system, you’ll actively engage with other students by participating in online discussions and collaborating on group activities

By the end of the program, you’ll be thoroughly prepared to pass the National School Psychology Examination (Praxis) 5403 exam.
