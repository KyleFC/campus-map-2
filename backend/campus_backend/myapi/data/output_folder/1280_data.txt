CORPORATE MATCHING GIFTS
Giving at Concordia University Irvine

Multiply your gift to Concordia by utilizing your employer’s matching gift program. Most publicly traded companies will match dollar for dollar and some will even double or triple the amount. Participating companies may also match gifts made by retirees and/or spouses.

Do you volunteer your time for Concordia? Some companies will make a grant to Concordia when you volunteer for a charity.

Discover if your company matches gifts by searching below or contacting your Human Resources (HR) department.
