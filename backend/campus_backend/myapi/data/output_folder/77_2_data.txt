Meet Your Professor

Professors in the Graphic Design Department are active participants in helping you develop and practice habits of learning that you will use over the span of your career. Our courses are developed and delivered by faculty who provide opportunities for you to learn through making and critique and where students are encouraged to express their faith through art.

Rachel Soo
Visual Arts Department Chair

Professor Soo is Co-Chair of the Art Department at Concordia University Irvine. She teaches digital image manipulation, digital illustration, digital publishing, typography, and graphic design classes. Utilizing both traditional and digital media, she creates artwork which investigates issues of identity and culture. She explores self-discovery by examining memories, perceptions and personal relationships. Professor Soo earned her BFA in Commercial Art from Concordia University in Nebraska, and an MFA in Integrated Visual Art from Iowa State University, Ames. Soo lives in Irvine with her husband and two sons.
