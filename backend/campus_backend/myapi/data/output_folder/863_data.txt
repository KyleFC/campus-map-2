What Others Say About Us
WRITING STUDIO
Undergraduate Testimonials
I always come away from sessions with the Writing Studio feeling inspired and confident about my writing. Everyone I've met with there is always open to questions, careful to make sure I understand what they're saying, and an excellent guide to the writing process!

Graduate Testimonials
[The Online Writing Lab] is extremely helpful, especially for a graduate student like myself who is returning to taking classes after almost 10 years from completing my undergrad degree. Getting back to writing papers is not easy, so the Writing Lab will definitely be helpful for me in future courses. I am an ESL student, so the Online Writing Lab helps me improve my writing skills. The writing consultants always provide critical/helpful feedback. I really appreciate their hard work and support.
