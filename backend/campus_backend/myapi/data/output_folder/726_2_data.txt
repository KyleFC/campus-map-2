Biography

Hi! I'm Rebecca Duport and I'm blessed to be called to serve my alma mater Concordia Irvine as an Assistant Professor and Director to the DCE Program of Christ College. Upon graduation from CUI in 1998, I've served Lutheran Churches as a Director of Christian Education (DCE) throughout the country (Idaho, Kentucky, Arkansas, Florida) in life-span education roles working with Children, Youth, Family, Older Adults. I cherish the relationships that God has allowed me the privilege to be a part of as a full-time DCE in His church for 16 years before coming to Concordia as a Professor in 2014. My service to the body of Christ also includes speaking at youth gatherings, conferences and leading training events for Family Friendly Partner's Network (FFPN). My husband Kyle and I enjoy spending time with our four boys and their events in scouting, sports and school.
