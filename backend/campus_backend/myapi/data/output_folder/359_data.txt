Monday, November 4, 2024

A long-standing tradition at Concordia University Irvine, our Golden Eagle Golf Classic is an invitation to spend a day playing the greens at the exclusive Coto de Caza Golf Club while we raise funds for our Golden Eagle Athletics.

Golfers will enjoy a full day of golf, with beverages and lunch provided.  The day will conclude with dinner, prize announcements (putting contest, longest drive, etc.)  and a gift basket raffle.

Coto de Caza
Golf & Racquet Club

Coto de Caza Golf & Racquet Club in Orange County features two courses designed by Robert Trent Jones Jr. The North course is a 7162-yard gem that opened in 1987 to rave reviews from pro and amateur alike. The South, a slightly shorter 6,950 yards, treats Members and guests to a golf course where players head south through the Coto canyon without seeing any other golf holes except the one they’re playing.
