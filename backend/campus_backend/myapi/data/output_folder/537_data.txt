Preparing professional educators

Teaching is one of the most rewarding professions you can be in today. Working with students, parents and colleagues is exciting and gratifying. Teachers stretch minds and transform people. Joining Concordia’s School of Education is your first step toward becoming a great teacher!

Every instructor in the School of Education has taught at either the elementary, middle-school or high school level and many have taught more than one grade. Faculty also contribute their experiences as principals, coaches, and school counselors to the information you will learn in class. You will learn from professionals who understand the history of education and are striving to make you the best teacher you can be for the future.

As you prepare for a career in education, it is important to know that Concordia’s Teacher Credential Program is a certified credential-granting institution with the State of California. CUI also offers training for the Lutheran Teaching Certificate through the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod. And if you wish to advance your career further, the School of Ed offers four Masters degrees and a Doctorate in Education.

We welcome you to the start of a career in teaching!

Sincerely,
