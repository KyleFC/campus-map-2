Volunteer

Your time and talents are vital to the university. Volunteers assist with coordinating events, organizing class reunion activities, welcoming students at the start of the school year, serving at events and much more.

GET INVOLVED

On workdays [in the Heritage Garden] we have students, faculty, staff, their children, community members and members of the local Native American tribe working together and having fun. Itâ€™s a great way to develop relationships and a sense of shared purpose.
