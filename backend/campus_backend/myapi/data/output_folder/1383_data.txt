Alex Guebert, Director

The handbell program at Concordia University is internationally respected for its high-quality and richly-varied performances. The program offers a breadth of opportunities for ringers and future directors. A handbell quartet and options for private lessons and private coaching are also part of the program.

Concert Handbells, the premier handbell ensemble, performs in the annual Christmas Concerts, Handbell Invitational Concerts, Young Ringers Festivals, campus Chapel services, Sunday outings, and concerts at area churches and on campus. Along with Spirit Bells, they have an annual fall retreat and go on a tour together during or after the spring semester. This ensemble is open by audition. Rehearsals are on Monday and Wednesday, 4:45-6:15.

Past Handbell Tours include:
2019: Las Vegas
2018: Phoenix
2017: Delta-Bay Area and Dr. Herb Geisler's Retirement
2016: Alaska
2015: Australia
