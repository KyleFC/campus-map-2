eaching and now teaches and coaches at the high school he attended.

Mike has been the Head Baseball at El Toro High School since 2001 and teaches Civics in the Social Science Department. Since 2001, his teams have won 10 League Championships, 2 CIF Championship (2008, 2017), and consistently ranked in the county, state, and nation. His teams have been ranked as high as #2 in Baseball America’s past preseason polls and recently came in at #14 for their 2017 poll. In 2017, El Toro ended up 27-7-1 and won the Division I CIF Championship at Dodger Stadium with a 4-0 over Corona High School. El Toro finished ranked #2 in California and in the top ten in the nation in various polls. As a result of the team's success, Mike was named the Cal-Hi Sports State Coach of the Year as well as the Southern California Baseball Coach of the Year.

Mike has been fortunate to have great players who have been awarded scholarships to various PAC 12, SEC, WAC, Big West schools such as Cal State Fullerton, Mississippi State, UC-Irvine, UCLA, Oregon, Fresno State, San Diego State, Gonzaga, Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Loyola Marymount, Nevada-Reno, as well as players sign professional contracts. Matt Chapman has been our highest drafted player being selected as the 25th player overall in the 1st round of the 2014 MLB draft. Mike has had 4 Rawlings Gold Glove winners in Nolan Arenado (Rockies/Cardinals), Mitchell Tolman (Oregon), Jayson Yano (Stevens) and Matt Chapman (CSF/Oakland A’s). Also, Matt Chapman made his MLB debut June 15, 2017 and became the third player along with Austin Romine and Nolan Arenado to reach the MLB from El Toro High School.

Probably one of the cooler moments in Mike’s career was when he and his wife flew to Colorado during the 2013 season to see the Rockies play the Yankees. Two of his former players, Nolan Arenado and Austin Romine, who were high school teammates in 2007 at El Toro, played against each other during inter-league play. Mike measures the character of a person on how they treat his family and it is hard to find two better people with more character than Nolan and Austin. Another proud moment took place in November of 2019 when Rawlings flew Mike and his wife to New York City to present the Rawlings Gold Glove and Platinum Glove to Nolan and Matt. They made history by being the only high school teammates to win the Gold Glove and Platinum Glove at 3B. Mike currently serves on the CIF-SS Baseball Coaches Advisory Committee which includes recommendations for rules and procedural changes, recommendations for playoff sites, assistance to coaches and officials organizations, and a liaison between coaches and officials organizations as well as notifying the CIF-SS office of the weekly Top Ten Poll.

Mike is married to his wife Angelica and they have four wonderful children Esperanza, Michael, Nacho, and Estrella.

Mike teaches the MCAA 577 Applied Exercise Sciences & Strategies for Coaching Baseball.

Biography

Coach Hagerty has 36 years of coaching experience including 28 as head coach. He is currently the Head Coach and Athletics Director at Bishop Amat High School, titles he has held since 2008.

Since 2008 and for the past 15 years, he has led Bishop Amat, with the exception of the spring of 2021 when they played a bizarre shortened 5 game schedule due to Covid, Coach Hagerty has led Bishop Amat to winning seasons and is typically ranked among the elite programs in California while competing in one of the top two football leagues in the state. He has won 5 league championships at Amat and in 2022 made it to the semifinals in Division II. This same season he achieved his 200th "W" as a head football coach. There are a very small percentage of head coaches who ever make it to that landmark number of victories.

He is considered in high school prep football circles to be one of the Top 5 Coaches in So Cal. More importantly, Steve has done a tremendous job of developing young men of stellar character and strong faith.

Personally, Coach Hagerty has bee
