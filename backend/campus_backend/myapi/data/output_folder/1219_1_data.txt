Study Abroad

Global experiences are extremely valuable to students to prepare them for working in a global society. When students study abroad they navigate unfamiliar territory and challenges that foster skills of adaptability, intercultural fluency, and critical thinking.

Concordia offers a variety of opportunities through both the Around the World Semester (ATW) and Study Abroad programs.
