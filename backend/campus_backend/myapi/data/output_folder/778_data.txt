Automated External Defibrillators (AED) Program
CAMPUS SAFETY
Objective of AED Program

Concordia University, Irvine has carefully placed 11 automated external defibrillators (AED) throughout its campus. The authorized (AED) program will enable targeted responders in a corporate setting to deliver early defibrillation to patients experiencing a sudden cardiac arrest. Responders’ use of the AED does not replace the care provided by professional emergency medical services (EMS) providers but is meant to provide a lifesaving bridge during the first few critical minutes it takes for advanced life support providers to arrive. Upon the arrival of EMS providers, patient care will be transferred.
