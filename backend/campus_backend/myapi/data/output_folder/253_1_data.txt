In May a group of our students travels to the Philippines to meet the aspiring entrepreneurs, teach new candidates and experience the culture and business environment of the Philippines. In doing so, students have the opportunity to help people around the world while developing skills that the workplace values. The Enactus team is featured in the Summer 2018 CUI Magazine.
