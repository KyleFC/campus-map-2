‌
Activities

Each day we will have a variety of Community Life Activities. Some of these will happen off campus to nearby places of interest. Excursions in the past have included a beach trip, a Major League Baseball game and more. Excursions for this year's Summer Experience will be revealed in the registration confirmation send a few weeks prior to the event date.

‌
Worship

The themes we explore at Crosswise are always considered through the lens of Scripture. Here, we will cultivate an attitude of worship each day as we exalt our Creator God and refocus our minds on Him.
