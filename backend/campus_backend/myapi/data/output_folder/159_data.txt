Mission Statement

Our mission in the Bursar's Office is to provide accurate and timely account information and reliable fiscal guidance to students in a high-quality professional manner.

Payment Information

Your direct cost of attendance includes: tuition, fees, and room and meals (if applicable). These charges are reflected on your student bill along with financial aid (grants and scholarships) and payments. Bills are sent to the e-mail addresses you have entered in MyRecords prior to the beginning of each semester.

Payments must be received by the due date (see above), whether you receive a Student Bill or not. It is the sole responsibility of the student to adhere to payment deadlines of his/her tuition and accommodating fees. If you make changes resulting in increased costs (after the payment deadline), you are required to make full payment of the difference when the changes are made. Tuition charges and fees are assessed when the student registers. Room and board charges are assessed upon assignments issued by our Housing Office. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that all necessary documents are submitted and approved by the correct department to allow housing and meal charges to reflect on the tuition bill. All tuition, fees, housing, and meal costs are due by the payment deadlines to avoid a $100 late fee. Nonpayment of tuition does not constitute an official drop/withdrawal from class.

Payments can be mailed in, made in person, or online. We accept cash, check and e-check, money order, and cashier's check.

Housing | Room and Board Payment Policy

Room and board must be paid along with tuition and fees by the posted payment deadlines for students to be eligible to check-in to the University’s dormitories. If the student chooses to withdraw from housing, they must contact the Office of Residential Life and fill out the necessary forms for the withdrawal to be valid. Refund percentages will be calculated using the same formula/dates as tuition and fees. If a student withdraws from housing or is terminated, the meal plan is turned off, and they will be held responsible for payment of the meal plan.

Refunds

Student refunds generated from excess student aid may be requested after the first day of classes. All financial aid requirements and documentation must be completed and approved before your refund is requested.

To process your refund most efficiently, we require valid bank account information and a current address on file. With this information on file, the refund will be deposited into your checking or savings account. To arrange for direct deposit to your preferred bank account, complete the online authorization form.

Financial Holds

A student who has past due debt to the University will be assessed a Bursar Hold. They will not be permitted to register in any program at the University. Holds are released when payment is received.

Alternative Payment Options

We provide semester Payment Plans and Alternative and Parent PLUS Loans as alternative payment methods. We will work with you to find the best option for you. If you enroll in a Payment Plan with Transact, you will carry a balance until all payments are made. It is the responsibility of the student to verify that the Plan Amount will pay off their semester balance. Payment Plan accounts are subject to a financial hold at the discretion of the University.

Returned or Nonsufficient (NSF) Payments

If you submit a payment for tuition and fees that is returned by your bank for nonpayment, the payment will be reversed and you will incur an Returned Payment fee. Below is additional information about why a check could have been returned by your bank and impacts your student account. The nonpayment may be caused by a number of reasons such as:

insufficient funds
a closed account
a non-transaction account
using an invalid account or routing number (Bank reports account cannot be locate)

You will receive an email if a payment made to your account does not go through once we are notified by the bank of the rejected payment. Upon notification of the returned item by either Transact Payments SmartPay or your bank, it is your responsibility to pay the outstanding amount and any associated fees immediately.  Your account may also be subject to a Bursar hold and the inability to use our online payment system.

Late Fees

If you fail to meet the payment deadline, you will be assessed a late payment fee in accordance with the payment deadline schedule. If you have extenuating circumstances regarding your late payment please send an email to bursar@cui.edu, after your balance aside from the late fee(s) has been resolved, indicating the following:

Your full name and student identification number
The semester or semesters in which you received the late payment fee
The circumstances that you wish to be reviewed
Financial Aid and Scholarship Recipients

If your financial aid and/or scholarship(s) do not cover your semester charges, it is your responsibility to seek alternative payment options for the amount of tuition remaining. The Credit/Anticipated Credit section of the bill reflects any aid that the University has received on your behalf. If you are aware of aid not reflected on your bill please contact the party responsible for your aid:

It should be noted that students must register Full-Time to receive Financial Aid. It is the student's responsibility to notify the Financial Aid Office if the student registers below 12 units. Please visit Financial Aid or The Bursar's Office for further information.
