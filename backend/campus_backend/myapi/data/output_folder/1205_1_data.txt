What is a PAL?

Peer Advising Leaders (PALs) are returning students who are eager to help you transition smoothly to Concordia. They are highly involved in orientation, both fall and spring. They are the first peer resources you meet upon your arrival on campus. Transfer students are assigned Transfer Mentors to assist with their transition. Feel free to contact them as they will be able to give you the student perspective of CUI and how to navigate it successfully.Your PAL is determined by your INT 100 section and they will be in your INT 100 class with you, so it helps to get to know them!

How do I pay for tuition, check on my financial aid package, and make sure the Wellness Center has all my paperwork?

These three areas (Bursar Office, Financial Aid, and the Wellness Center) will be available at Orientation Check-in if needed to clear any holds. They are the clearance portion of your orientation. If you follow the steps to on the admitted student checklist page, you can speed up your check-in process upon arrival.

How do I waive or enroll in the Concordia University, Irvine Student Health Insurance Plan?

Visit the Wellness Center's Health Insurance page for further information on how to waive or enroll in the CUI Student Health Insurance Plan online. Students who have not waived the insurance plan by the deadline will automatically be enrolled in the CUI Student Health Insurance Plan and be billed for it.

‌
What prevents me from completing the Clearance process at Check-in?

Upon your acceptance, you are responsible for completing the necessary paperwork to ensure your status as a student. If you have outstanding paperwork (which results in a Hold) when you arrive for Orientation Check-in, you will be required to meet with those offices that day. Holds that are not taken care of can result in your classes being dropped, prohibiting you from registering for classes, or having to move out of your residence hall. Visit the New Student Checklist to ensure you have completed the necessary items and have a smooth check-in process.

‌
What if I can't get cleared? Can I still attend classes? Can I move into housing?

If you are told by one of the offices at check-in that they are not able to clear you that day, please check with the RES team. They will assist you in continuing on with the process.

‌
Where do I get my student ID card?

If you submit your ID Card application form ahead of time, your ID card will be ready to pick up at Check-in the Friday of WOW. ID card pictures can be taken at the Academic Department and Campus Resource Fair on Friday of WOW or in the Campus Safety Office (Admin 103) during the first week of school. You will need your ID card to activate your meal plan. It is very important to keep this card for the entire time you attend Concordia as it serves as your library card and meal card. You will be charged for replacement ID Cards.

All communication from the University will be sent to your Eagles email address so it is vital to check it at least once a week.
