The Concordia Experience
Campus Ministry

Concordia University Irvine provides an active and thriving campus ministry with many different choices and styles for worship. With both contemporary and traditional daily chapel services, Bible studies and mission projects, there is something for everyone.

Our Mission: Making Disciples of a New Generation

We're all about getting to know Jesus through authentic worship, study, and service. We worship 1300+ in attendance every week at 5 different services. We offer a dozen small groups to study God's Word. We reach out to serve in places like the Gulf Coast, Mexico, Guatemala, and Hungary.

So Come Grow with Us...

...and discover an exciting community of college students and 20-somethings who are connected in Christ.
