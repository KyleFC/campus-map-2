The Value of a College Minor

By declaring a minor, you’ll have the opportunity to pursue interests that might lie outside of your major. Gaining extra knowledge in an area that interests you can also help you in your future career! Not only will your skills and knowledge be more well-rounded, but you’ll also prove to future employers that you’re willing to work hard and exceed their expectations.

Curriculum

Many Concordia students who major in other fields also choose to complete their elective requirements with a formal program of study in music called the Music Minor.

Concert Attendance
Students must document attendance at 10 concerts/recitals during their time at Concordia. An updated list will be published at the end of each semester detailing concert attendance. In the semester when students expect to pass 10, they should enroll in MUS 100 for pass/fail certification. Attendance credit is not allowed for recitals/concerts in which the student is a performer for the majority of the repertoire.
