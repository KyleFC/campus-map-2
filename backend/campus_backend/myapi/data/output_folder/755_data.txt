Withdrawals and Refunds / Title IV
OFFICE OF THE BURSAR
Procedure

Refunds are processed weekly. (Updated: 09/20/23)

Refunds of private loans, federal and state aid are automatically processed on Fridays. Refund checks will not be available for pick up. Refunds will only be mailed or direct deposit (see below). Please make sure your address is up to date in MyRecords.

No Exceptions will be made.

Overpayments

If you’ve paid more than your charges for tuition, fees and room and board (if living on campus) you may be entitled to a refund. Refunds should be requested from your eagles.cui.edu email address to bursar@cui.edu.

Refund of Federal Title IV Funds

Federal Title IV financial aid (Federal Student and Parent Loans, Federal Pell Grants and Federal SEO Grants) will be applied to all your allowable charges (tuition, fees, room and board) for the current semester.

The application of these funds will supersede all University payment plans and contracts. Federal law states that any funds over and above allowable charges for the current semester must be refunded to the student within 14 days after disbursement.

Financial Aid Recipients:
Your refund check will be processed within 14 days of your credit being reflected on your account.

Title IV Refund Policy

The Federal Title IV refunds policy operates independently of the Concordia University refund policy. A student who has received Title IV funds and withdraws may owe the University for charges no longer covered by returned federal aid. There are federal provisions governing the return of federal financial assistance for financial aid recipients who completely withdraw from school in any semester. The policy governs all Federal loans and grant programs, including Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loans, PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grant, Federal SEOG, and other Title IV programs except Federal Work-Study.

Per federal guideline standards, a student must "earn" federal financial aid awards directly in proportion to the number of days of the term attended. In other words, a student earns financial assistance as they attend class. If a student completely withdraws from all classes during a term, the University must calculate the portion of the total scheduled financial assistance earned. The portion of federal loans and grants the student is entitled to earn is calculated on a percentage basis by comparing the total number of calendar days in the semester to the number of days completed before total withdrawal. The total withdrawal date for calculating the Return of Title IV financial assistance will be determined by the University as the date the student officially withdraws per the institutional procedures.

It is the student's responsibility to immediately notify the Registrar's Office that they are withdrawing. The Office of the Registrar is located on the 1st floor of the Grimm Hall Building. They may be reached at 949-214-3079.

Questions about the Title IV refund amounts should be directed to your financial aid office at finaid@cui.edu or by calling 949-214-3066.

Title IV Federal Funds: Tuition, Fees, Room and Board

Tuition and Fees: Through Title IV, the University takes the responsibility on behalf of the student to credit the student's account with federal funds to satisfy current charges for tuition and fees.
Room and Board: Through Title IV, excess federal funds creating a credit balance after tuition and fees are paid in full can be used to pay for room and board charges. The student is immediately responsible for the entire outstanding balance that is not covered by financial assistance.

Any credit balances created by disbursements of Title IV funds on the student's account must be paid by the University directly to the student or parent borrower as soon as possible, but no later than 14 days after one of the following as agreed to on the Bursar's Office Budgetary Agreement Form:

The beginning of the semester
After loan disbursement causing a credit balance
The date the school received notice from the student or parent borrower to cancel his or her authorization on a Bursar's Office Budgetary Agreement Form to have the school manage a credit balance
Withdrawal Tuition Charges and Refunds Due to Dropped Courses

Students withdrawing from the university or dropping courses within the refund period may be eligible for a refund of charges in accordance with the University's fee schedule and refund procedures. Students who withdraw from school after classes begin may inquire about a refund (i.e., tuition, room, board) by contacting the Bursar's Office. Class fees, new student orientation fee are not refundable. Student service fee is not refundable after the census date.

The student is responsible for paying any outstanding charges to the University. Dropping courses or withdrawing from the university may or may not result in a credit on the student's account. Please contact the Bursar's Office for further information.
