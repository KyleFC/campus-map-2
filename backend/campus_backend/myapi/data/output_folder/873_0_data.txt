Writing Fear, Writing Love

By Dylan Arant, Writing Studio Consultant
Posted on 10/27/2023 - 3 minute read

Seeing as this is the season of ghouls, goblins, and ghosts, I have been thinking about the use of fear in creative writing and literature.

Speaking biologically, fear is our emotional response to a detected threat, to the end that we might find safety. Because of our intense instinct for self-preservation, we are afraid of that which may pose a danger to our health. This is what I shall dub “selfish fear”: the base survival instinct experienced by even the lowest forms of animal life.

The Importance of Being Ruthless

By Ella Hachee, Writing Studio Consultant
Posted on 10/2/2023 - 3 minute read

Even if you don’t plan to become a professional writer, learning to write well sets you apart as a communicator across all professions. Small tweaks elevate good writing into great writing, especially when you’re given limited space to convey your ideas: 250 characters, 5 pages, or just an easily distracted reader.

Do Yourself a Favor: Get a Writing Buddy

By Johanna Saleska Lange, Online Writing Lab consultant
Posted on 8/30/2023 - 5 minute read

A writing buddy is exactly what it sounds like—a person with whom you share writing ideas and goals, exchange drafts and feedback, commiserate about writing frustrations, and celebrate writing successes. A good writing buddy is like this incredible hybrid of colleague and best friend: they hold you accountable to your writing goals, but they’re also there to encourage you over a cup of coffee when you fail.

Posted on 2/20/2023 - 6 minute read

Remember when writing was fun? What ever happened to those creative writing assignments, to writing stories and poems on construction paper with crayons? There was no “wrong” way to invent a character or silly scenario—back then, writing was pure joy!

3 Tips for Citing Credible Sources ... Trust Me

By Leonard Memon, Writing Studio Consultant
Posted on 2/9/2023 - 3 minute read

The common neo-Aristotelean method of rhetorical criticism examines three aspects of rhetoric: Logos (appeal to logic), ethos (appeal to credibility), and pathos (appeal to emotion). Aristotle found ethos to be the most important of the three. To promote ethos, authors should cite credible sources. It is crucial to cite reliable sources to strengthen your credibility as an author and to avoid plagiarism. To cite credible sources in a research paper, you should…

Are you staring at a blank screen, unsure how to start your paper? Outlining is here to help! The key to efficiently writing a first draft is preparation beforehand. For me, it is much easier to figure out how I will say my ideas once I have figured out what those ideas will be.

The Tempestuous Eve: My Scholastic Dread

Posted on 10/31/2022 - 3 minute read

Rain and wind slapped against the side of my friend’s house. It was an old, creaky house in the northeast, and thunder shook the walls. My friend and I didn’t mind, though. Nestled on a worn couch in the small den, we relished in the solace of that poorly lit, cramped space—a comfort amidst the storm understood only by people who have lived in cold, rainy places. A shared sense of victory, too, enflamed our spirits. Finals week was almost over. I had only had one task remaining—to pen the last paragraph of my final essay. Lightning flashed, briefly illuminating rain drops creeping down the window. Thunder crashed, shaking the lonely house. Little did I know, my victory dance was about to turn into a macabre tango of terror.

[Placeholder Title] - Change Later: The Importance of Placeholders in Essay Writing

Posted on 10/10/2022 - 2 minute read

The first words of an essay can be torture to write. With no clear idea as to the direction of the paper, a frustrated writer will struggle, either writing a short, vague introduction or a long, rambling one. Neither of these outcomes is desirable. An introduction needs to be robust, both an engaging hook to get the audience invested as well as a successful preview of the essay's main points and thesis. However, it is often difficult to write a successful introduction until you k
