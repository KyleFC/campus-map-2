Alternate DCE Certification Routes

We offer two online alternate DCE certification routes. These alternate certification routes are intended for adult learners who desire to transition professionally to DCE ministry and have professional or volunteer experience in a Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) congregation. The following options are available:

For students already working in a relevant ministry position in a church or church-related context, the online Christian Education Leadership Degree (CEL) with Director of Christian Education (DCE) Certification allows you to earn a bachelor’s, or complement an existing degree with a second BA and DCE certification.
Students may complete the Master of Arts in Theology with DCE certification.

Our classes include live sessions, so you will have the opportunity to interact with your professors and fellow students. Summer intensive courses are required. Prior course work in related fields will be evaluated for inclusion for certification purposes, but not for MA credit. More information will be provided during the application process.

If you have any questions about the DCE Program, please contact the Director, Prof. Rebecca Duport '98.
