GRADUATES OF THE LAST DECADE (GOLD)
2023 Honor Roll of Donors
Graduates of the Last Decade (GOLD) 2023

Graduates of the last decade are alumni who graduated in the last ten years. These recent graduates qualify for Pacesetter benefits when they give $500 cumulative across campus, rather than the traditional membership requirement of $1,000 per year. We thank these donors for supporting Concordia so early on in their careers.
