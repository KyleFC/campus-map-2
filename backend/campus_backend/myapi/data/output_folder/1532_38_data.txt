esday, March 18.

The safety of our students and employees is our top priority. While CUI's campus remains open, and no cases of COVID-19 have been reported on our campus, we have activated this response to limit the spread of the virus. In accordance with the advisory issued recently by the California Department of Public Health and Governor Gavin Newsom, the University has taken the actions that are listed below. However, this situation remains very fluid. Members of the CUI COVID-19 Response Team are in constant, close communication with local and statewide healthcare agencies. We will be issuing regular updates in the coming days.

Existing online courses will continue without disruption.
All CUI classes will remain online until the end of finals week for the Spring Semester.

Guidance for Individuals who are ill or who are in High-Risk Groups
If you are ill, stay home or stay in your dorm room. Do not go to class. Contact the Wellness Center for a same-day appointment (949-214-3102).
Students who have underlying health conditions that put them at risk for complications from COVID-19 are encouraged to reach out to the Wellness Center for guidance.
Students who are at high risk and who wish to pursue alternative education arrangements should contact the Wellness Center. Similar alternative accommodations are being offered to our faculty and staff.

The Concordia University Irvine community is understandably experiencing various emotional responses to the outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. Fear, anxiety, sorrow, worry, uncertainty are all very normal responses. However, Concordia is a community and a family. We care deeply for one another. Please hold one another up in prayer, reach out to friends who are experiencing anxiety and fear, and know that the faculty and staff are here to support all of you. During these times, we also should lean upon our Lord Jesus Christ.

The Psalmist reminds us where to turn when we are feeling scared and fearful: God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore, we will not fear. (Psalm 46:1-2a). May God provide you and your families a measure of comfort and strength in the coming days.

For His Students,
Dr. Michael A Thomas
President of Concordia University Irvine
