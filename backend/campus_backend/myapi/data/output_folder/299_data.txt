OUR program

Our aim is to develop general musicianship, performance, musical collaboration, and critical listening, along with an understanding of various contexts of music. Ensembles — comprised of orchestras, jazz, choirs, worship, commercial music, handbell, and chamber — are open to students studying to be music professionals, as well as students who are non-music majors but desire to perform for the joy of music.

The center is home to a magnificent Casavant organ — one of the finest instruments in Orange County — as well as a grand piano by Steinway.

The Good Shepherd Chapel

The Good Shepherd Chapel is used regularly for solo recitals and chamber music. It is an intimate hilltop venue with seating for 100 featuring city views and warm acoustics. It also houses a two-manual Schlicker pipe organ.
