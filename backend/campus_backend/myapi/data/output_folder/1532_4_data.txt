 be in place through January 28, 2021 and will be reevaluated prior to that date.

COVID-19 Testing for Spring 2022

There is no COVID-19 testing requirement in place for students returning to campus after Christmas Break. However, certain groups of students will be required to take a COVID-19 test in order to be cleared to participate in campus co-curricular activities. All student athletes, music, theatre, and forensics students will receive a communication about scheduling a test after their return to campus in January. All other students may request a COVID-19 test, but are not required to be tested to return to residence halls, in-person classes, or other campus activities.

New COVID-19 Testing Options

Concordia University Irvine has partnered with a new provider, Color, to provide free COVID-19 testing for faculty, staff, and students. There will also be expanded testing opportunities for individuals who must test regularly. Students and employees can set up an account with Color to expedite testing, and results texted directly to the individual within 24-48 hours.

More information and registration instructions for setting up an account with Color will be posted soon.

We strongly advise students and employees who are experiencing illness during Christmas Break to delay their return to campus until their symptoms resolve. Students who have been identified as a close contact of an individual diagnosed with COVID-19 during the semester break, please notify the Wellness Center at wellness@cui.edu. Employees identified as close contacts should contact hr@cui.edu.

Updated International Air Travel Requirements

Starting December 6, all air passengers, regardless of vaccination status, must show a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than one day before travel to the United States. All students and employees who plan to travel internationally during the semester break should consult the updated CDC travel requirements.
