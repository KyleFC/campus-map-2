essor Zarubin has an extensive background in education, most recently at Sage Hill School, where he taught several advanced biology courses, led international travel courses, and developed opportunities for student research in molecular genetics. He enjoys the opportunity to share his love of the natural world with students, but also engage with and guide them in scientific research, and bring his love of Jesus and his love of science into the classroom where a deeper understanding of the Creator and His creation will flourish. Professor Zarubin also serves as the Director of the CUI Heritage Garden, where students, faculty, and the local community have the opportunity to ecosystem gardening.
