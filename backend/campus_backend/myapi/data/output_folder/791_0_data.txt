Renewals

If you wish to keep the material(s) past the due date, you must RENEW the material(s). The library does NOT accept phone renewals, but you can renew the materials yourself using OneSearch [see instructions below] or by bringing the items to the library. There is only one renewal per item. If additional use is necessary, the material must be checked in and then checked out again. Items that are overdue MUST be checked back in at the front desk before they can be renewed.

To renew online:

Go to Research Tools and OneSearch.
Click on “Sign In.”
Login. Your Library ID is your E# and Canvas password.
Once logged in, the box in the upper-right corner will change to your first name. Click the box and select “My Account.”
Click “Renew” next to the item you want to renew. Or click “Renew All” at the bottom of the screen to renew all items listed.
Course Reserves

The Schroeder Library Reserves are located behind the Circulation Desk. These materials are made available by the faculty for the exclusive use of students. The purpose of placing materials on reserve is to ensure their availability to a large number of students in a short period of time. At Concordia, there are several types of reserve: 3-hours (in Library use only), 12-hours (overnight), 3-days, and 7-days. The library staff cannot change the type of reserve without the written permission from the faculty member.

Reserve materials may be searched in the online catalog by clicking this link: Course Reserves. Searching is available by the instructor's name or course name.

For more information on submitting a digital reserve request or accessing items on reserve, please visit our Course Reserve Research Guide.

Overdue Policy

Our goal is to encourage the timely return of library materials and provide for optimal sharing of the collection. Patrons are responsible for returning or renewing items by the due date. The Library sends all notices to students' Concordia University email accounts. Overdue notices are a courtesy and non-receipt or late receipt does no
