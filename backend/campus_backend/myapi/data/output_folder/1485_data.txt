Quito Semester

The Quito Semester exists to provide an excellent academic semester where students will engage in the challenges of a developing nation and learn to respond with an appropriate Christian worldview.

Ecuador is one of Latin America's most diverse countries. While in Ecuador, you can experience the high mountains, low desert, tropical rainforest, coastal beauty, the Galapagos Islands, and the deep Amazon Jungle.

This semester abroad opportunity is based in Quito, the nation's capital. Quito has amazing weather and is famous for its eternal springtime conditions. The city offers rich history, architecture, friendly people, and safe living conditions in which to grow and learn. Living and Learning in Quito is part of a 15-year-old organization called Youth World. This program offers an amazing mixture of adventure, academic excellence, culture, practical experience, language, mission, and integrated living as you participate in this semester abroad program.
