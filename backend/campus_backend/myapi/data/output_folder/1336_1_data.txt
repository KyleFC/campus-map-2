e student eligible for scholarships or grants.

Q. Are Graduate students eligible to apply for Professional Judgment?
A. No, Graduate students are not eligible for Professional Judgment. This is because Graduate students are only eligible for Direct Unsubsidized Loans. You are not required to show financial need to receive a Direct Unsubsidized Loan so changes to the FAFSA that impact the EFC will not change the type or amount of aid offered.

Who is my financial aid counselor?

Visit our Staff page or email our office at finaid@cui.edu to schedule an appointment. You can also come in-person to discuss Professional Judgment with your financial aid counselor. The Financial Aid Office is located on the 2nd Floor of Grimm Hall, North (next to the School of Business) and is open Monday-Friday from 8 am to 4:30 pm.
