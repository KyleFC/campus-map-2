Accreditation

Concordia University Irvine is fully accredited by the WASC Senior College and University Commission (WSCUC), one of six regional bodies that supervise accreditation for colleges and universities throughout the United States.

The Commission Action Letter of July 7, 2014 reaffirms Concordia's accreditation for a period of ten years, extending through June 2024, and specifically commends Concordia for:

its innovative and rigorous Core Curriculum;
its expanded efforts in curricular and co-curricular assessment of student learning outcomes;
its exemplary commitment to student success; and
its improvement in financial stability and sustainability.

The Commission's action was based in part on a visit report submitted by a peer review team led by Dr. Jonathan Parker, Provost of California Baptist University, Riverside, CA. (See page 21 for the team's specific commendations and recommendations for Concordia.)

Both the Commission Action Letter and the visiting team's report are public documents and may be accessed on this page, and at the WASC Senior College and University Commission website.

For further information, please contact Concordia's Accreditation Liaison Officer, Deborah Lee, at deborah.lee@cui.edu or (949)214-3433.
