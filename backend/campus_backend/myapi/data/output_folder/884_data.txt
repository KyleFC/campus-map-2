DONOR ADVISED FUNDS
Supporting Concordia University Irvine

 

For your convenience, we are providing links to the mostly commonly used Donor Advised Funds. Concordia University Irvine has already received DAF grants from these funds so the recommendation process should be easy.

Support Concordia students, staff, faculty and community by investing in Concordia through your Donor Advised Fund. It is easy! Follow one of these links to log in to your existing account.
