ABSN Prerequisite Courses

Concordia University Irvine’s Accelerated BSN program is an intensive 15-month nursing program where students with a non-nursing bachelor’s degree or a minimum of 65 non-nursing college credits can earn a BSN degree. Because of the intensive nature of this accelerated program, it is vital to start the program with the background knowledge needed to succeed. Therefore, we require several ABSN prerequisites.

You may have already completed many of these courses through your prior college credits, especially if you majored in the sciences. Your admissions counselor will review your educational history with you to determine which prerequisites can be met by transferring credits from your prior courses and which you still need to complete. Together, you will develop a plan for completing the remaining prerequisites.

ABSN Prerequisite Courses for Concordia

With the exception of NTHL 101 and NTHL 202, students may transfer all required pre-requisite units from any regionally accredited institution*. Online science classes that solely rely on virtual laboratories will not be accepted. However, online science classes that incorporate home-kit laboratories are acceptable.(Refer to the end of the page for current exceptions).

Applicants may choose to complete prerequisite classes at Concordia University Irvine as "non-degree seeking" students. These classes will be offered as undergraduate classes which will follow Concordia University Irvine's catalog requirement and undergraduate's schedules. Non-degree seeking students are limited to twelve (12) units per semester.
