Concordia University Irvine Parent Connection

Families often experience an adjustment period when a child enters a new university, whether they are entering as a first-year student, transferring from another college or university, living on campus, or commuting. As a parent, you have also begun a new phase in life as you take a supportive role in your student's newest endeavor.

We want to assure you that you will not be alone in experiencing this transition. Our campus staff is dedicated to support and assure the well-being of your student as well as address any questions or concerns you have. Specifically, the Office of First-Year Experience is geared toward providing you student resources that ensure a smooth transition.

We value our partnerships with parents and family members as we strive to develop your student into a wise, honorable, and cultivated student. To successfully develop a supportive network for your student, we ask for your assistance in fostering your student's growth as they will be seeking your guidance and advice throughout their time at Concordia.

We encourage you to be a member of our parent mailing where you will receive newsletters, our University's magazine, The Concordia Today, and event invitations by enrolling in the free Concordia University Irvine Parent Connection Association.
