Instructor, Erik Der

The handbell program at Concordia University is internationally respected for its high-quality and richly varied performances as well as breadth of opportunities for ringers and future directors, in three ensembles. A handbell quartet, private lessons and private coaching are also part of the program.

This quartet plays in both Handbell Invitational Concerts, Young Ringers Festival, Spring Handbell Concert, and tours. They rehearse once a week and are an auditioned ensemble.
