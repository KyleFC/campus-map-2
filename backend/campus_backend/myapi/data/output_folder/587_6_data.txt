. The following season, Ammann’s squad finished fifth in the league with a 17-11 overall record and a 12-8 conference mark as the school continued its 3-year transition from NAIA.

During the 2014-2015 campaign, Ammann led the Eagles to a 27-8 overall record and 13-3 conference record in the Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC). The Eagles capped off that season with their 11th trip to the NAIA National Tournament in 14 years.

Ammann was named the 2011-2012 NAIA National Coach of the Year for the second time in his career after leading the Eagles to the 2012 National Championship. Concordia defeated Oklahoma Baptist 72-69 in Kansas City, Missouri to claim the program's second national title.

Ammann also led the Green and Gold to the NAIA finals in 2007 and 2004 where the Eagles finished as NAIA runner-up.

In only his second season (2002-03), Ammann led the Eagles to their first NAIA National Championship in school history. Concordia outlasted Mountain State in overtime by a count of 88-84 to claim the title. The 36 wins the Eagles compiled that season were the most of any level of college basketball that year and Ammann was also named NAIA National Coach of the Year.

In his career, Ammann has coached 20 All-Americans, 10 All-Tournament members, four Charles Stevenson Hustle Award winners, one Chuck Taylor Most Valuable Player Award winner (Cameron Gliddon, 2012), one NAIA National Player of the Year (Justin Johnson, 2011), four GSAC Player of the Year winners, and 28 All-Conference honorees, all while being named GSAC Coach of the Year four times. Ammann and his staff have also developed a recruiting pipeline to Australia. Since 2007, at least one Australian basketball player has been on the CUI men's basketball roster. Recent Eagles hailing from Australia include Gerlach, Gliddon, Tad Dufelmeier and brothers Anderson and Austin Clarke.

Ammann earned his bachelor’s in psychology at Stanford and holds a master’s degree from San Jose State in the same field, which was conferred in 1994. He began his coaching career immediately, serving as an assistant coach at San Jose State (1993-94), Canada College (1995-96), Pepperdine (1997-99) and Azusa Pacific (2000-01). Prior to his time at Concordia, he spent a year at Cal State Bakersfield and Santa Ana College, respectively, before transferring to Stanford.

At Stanford, Ammann started every game of his career under head coach Mike Montgomery. He averaged 12 points a game for the Cardinal and helped lead Stanford to a NIT Championship in 1991. In addition, he earned Academic All-American honors and was named to the Dean’s List. He is a graduate of Edison High School and was inducted into the Edison Hall of Fame in 2019.

Ammann and his wife, Marina, live in Tustin and have five children, Madelyn, Frank, Jourden, Andrew and Tyler.

Our MCAA program was the first of it's kind and is still second to none. It is a privilege to be involved as an instructor and I have enjoyed meeting coaches of all ages and experience levels from around the country.
