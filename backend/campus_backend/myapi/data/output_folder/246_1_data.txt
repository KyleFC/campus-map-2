Culture Fest

CultureFest is an annual tradition and the longest-running campus-wide event at Concordia University Irvine. In addition to an outdoor lunch and mainstage performances, international students step up to represent and share their culture through food, visual displays, dress, and storytelling.

International Student Ambassadors

International Student Ambassadors (a.k.a. ISAs) are a team of globally engaged local or international student volunteers who are positioned to help new international students feel welcome and supported at Concordia. As a student leadership position, the ISA role can strengthen resumes, serve as a foundation for requesting references from International Center staff, and function as a preparation for future opportunities.
