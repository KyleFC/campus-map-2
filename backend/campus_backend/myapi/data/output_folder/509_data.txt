Curriculum Summary
CROSS-CULTURAL MINISTRY CENTER
Curriculum Summary

Meeting the multi-cultural contextual needs of 21st Century America and the needs of the LCMS, the Cross-cultural Ministry Center (CMC) provides academic and practical training, forming missionary pastors and church leaders who are skilled at crossing cultures and reaching the lost with the Gospel.

Together, the academic and practical portions of the curriculum total 106 semester hours. Additionally, students whose primary language is English must become familiar with a modern spoken language other than English by successfully completing 6 semester credits (or equivalent) of undergraduate level language courses.

Practical

All course work in the CMC is embedded in real-life ministry and mission experience. We call this embedded learning experience the “CMC Missional Vicarage.” It is four years of in-field mission and ministry experience, is required for both the M.A. Theology and Certification, and runs concurrently with your coursework. Students register for a vicarage "course" every semester until they have completed all eight of them. In each vicarage "course" you plan activities, carry out those activities, and then journal your progress. Typically, in the first half of the Missional Vicarage, you carry out basic mission and ministry activities at a local church. In the second half, you plan and finally launch a new ministry in the community that crosses a significant cultural barrier and reaches the lost outside of the church in the surrounding community. All of this is closely coordinated with district facilitators and carried out under the guidance of a local congregation, a Mentor Pastor, and a CUI Faculty Supervisor. The vicarage "courses" are:
