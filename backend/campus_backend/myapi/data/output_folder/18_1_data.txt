Concordia University Irvine ABSN Program Site 10750 Fourth St. Rancho Cucamonga, CA 91730
The ABSN program at Concordia is challenging, intense, and rewarding. There is nothing like it — the morals and values integrated in the program alongside the nursing curriculum are unique to the school. Students receive much more than their education, and the lifelong lessons I have learned at Concordia are invaluable.
