EMILY MCCARTHY
Graphic Design Major
Marketing Minor

What do you hope to do with the skills you've gained at Concordia University IrvineÂ after graduation?

After graduation, I plan on pursuing a job in graphic design or marketing. No matter what career path I choose, I hope to be able to impact the culture in a positive way, in my career and other creative endeavors.

What is your favorite thing about Concordia University Irvine?

I truly value the Christian environment that Concordia has to offer. Looking back on the many colleges I visited in high school, CUI stood out to me because of its friendly and warm atmosphere. The professors here truly care about their students, which makes all the difference. As a graphic design major, I've had many classes with Prof. Soo, and she is the best!
