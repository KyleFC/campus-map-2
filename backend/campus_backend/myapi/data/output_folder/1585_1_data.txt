Journey through John

The forty days of Lent are a season of spiritual reflection and preparation as we follow our Savior, Jesus, through his passion, death, and resurrection for our sake. We invite you to join us each day in Lent for a brief time in God’s word. Concordia University Irvine campus pastor Quinton Anderson has written a series of reflections on John’s Gospel. Each day will feature a reading, a devotional reflection, and a prayer. We pray this is a blessing to you as you follow Jesus. Join us, this Lent, on a “Journey through John.”

If you would like to receive email reminders as these daily reflections are posted, you can subscribe to our email list that is dedicated solely to these Lenten devotions.

In Christ,

Steve Mueller
Chief Mission Officer
Dean of Christ College
