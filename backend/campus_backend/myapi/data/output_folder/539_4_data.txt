Biography

Taylor has joined the School of Education and Admission department as an admissions counselor for the Masters of Coaching and Athletic Administration. She hails to Irvine from Bakersfield, California. When she was a senior in high school she toured Concordia University and fell in love with the atmosphere, environment and overall campus life. She was a four year Eagle athlete as a member of the Concordia tennis team from 2014 To 2018. She is family oriented and enjoys spending time with her parents, Tom and Tiffany, as well as her sister, Tessa. Taylor is a double alumni, in 2018 she received her bachelorâ€™s degree in Exercise Sports Science and in 2019 she earned her Master of Science degree in Exercise Sports Science and Coaching. I am very excited to be a part of the MCAA team at Concordia University, Irvine.
