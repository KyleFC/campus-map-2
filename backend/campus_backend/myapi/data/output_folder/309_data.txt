Hungary Mission Trip

Dates: Jun 18- Jul 10
Application Deadline: January 9th
Trip Cost: $3500
Leader: Campus Pastor Quinton Anderson
Number of Possible Participants: 15

Summary of Service:
This mission team will run two week-long English camps for junior high and high school students with the intention of strengthening their Christian faith or introducing them to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

These camps run all day, consisting of English class, sports, crafts, music, Bible studies, scavenger hunts and disco dances. Each day continues into late night conversations as we stay in the dormitories with the students building deep relationships. The impact has translated not only to the Hungarian students responding to the Gospel, but often taking the Gospel home to their families. In addition it is a joy to watch our students grow through this experience, not only in passion for the life-giving Gospel as they watch it impact the life of another, but in their skills to teach and share the Word.
