Q&A with Elisabeth

Where are you from?
Huntington Beach. California

What did you study in college?
I attended Concordia University Irvine and earned my Bachelor's Degree in Liberal Studies: Elementary Education. While at Concordia, I also completed my Multiple Subject Teaching Credential. I later earned my Masters in Teaching English to Students of Other Languages (TESOL).

What is your favorite place to eat in Irvine?
Sergeant Pepperoni's has amazing pizza and garlic knots!

What do you like to do with your free time?
I love spending quality time with my husband and our son, going out to restaurants, traveling, and being with our family and friends.

What advice do you have for students going through the admissions process?
Trust your gut! Choosing your college is a huge and exciting decision. Learn as much as you can, communicate your needs, and ask for help. You need to make the best choice for YOU! You should feel good about choosing your home for the next four years.
