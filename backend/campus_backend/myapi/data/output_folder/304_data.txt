CONCORDIA UNIVERSITY IRVINE

SEP

2023

Tuesday, September 26, 2023

We invite you to join the Concordia Community for CONCORDIA serves! Last year, over 1,000 members of our Concordia family stepped into the community on one day, called to give to others from the abundance they have been given. The 5th Annual CONCORDIA serves will engage alumni, students, faculty, staff, parents, donors, and friends around the world to serve where they are, in the way they can.

We're sorry.

LEARN MORE

Our service to the community does not end here.

Concordia University, as the Great Commission University, focuses on teaching service through experiential learning. Many classes integrate service-learning through community service opportunities both locally and globally. You can also serve through Global and Local Missions to improve the lives of those around you. Concordia's clubs and organizations perform community service projects at least once a semester. Various leadership groups also orient their programs around serving others, fundraising for non-profit organizations, and learning what it means to be Christ in the world.

Here are a few of our programs that offer service-learning:

Around-the-World Semester®
First-Year Experience
Global and Local Missions
