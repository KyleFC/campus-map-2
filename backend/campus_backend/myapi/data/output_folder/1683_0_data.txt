Pacesetters 2021

The Concordia University Foundation established the Pacesetter Program as a means of recognizing and honoring donors who share the vision of this Christian University, which is dedicated to faithfulness to Christ Jesus and to academic excellence. A donor who has contributed $1,000 or more to any area on campus is recognized as a Pacesetter. For this support, the students, staff, faculty, alumni, campus regents, trustees and volunteer leaders are eternally grateful.
