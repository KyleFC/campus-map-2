Concordia Partners With PBS for National Airings of Award-Winning Christmas Specials
 A Concordia Christmas

Since 2020, Concordia University Irvine has partnered with PBS to produce and televise our annual Christmas concerts and performances. Our concerts showcase Concordia’s excellent Music Department, from choirs and ensembles to orchestra, commercial music, and more. New arrangements of carols by Concordia faculty and alumni are also featured.

These made-for-TV productions wouldn’t be possible without top local music venues like the Segerstrom Center for the Arts or Concordia’s exceptional music facilities, including the newest building on campus, the Borland-Manske Center, which features a world-class recording studio. Concordia students, even non-music majors, have the unique opportunity to take part in these award-winning productions.

Past Performances
2020 - All is Bright!
2021 - Repeat the Sounding Joy
2022 - The Thrill of Hope
Awards

Concordia’s Christmas specials have won a number of Telly awards since partnering with PBS, joining major media companies like Disney, Hearst, and Warner Bros in the prestigious category of gold winners.
