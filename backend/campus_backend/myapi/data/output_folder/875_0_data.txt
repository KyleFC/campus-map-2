AROUND-THE-WORLD SEMESTER®

Academics are not only an important part of the ATW experience, they often involve some of the most exciting adventures. Classes are often held "on location," meaning that students discuss and learn about a historical document in the very place the text was composed. The ATW learning community is an adventure in itself because most students have never shared an identical class schedule with 25 of their closest friends. There are no shallow, meaningless "group projects" rather, ATW collaboration is faculty-directed, accountable, and motivated from within the team. The students come together to accomplish a staggering academic feat, reading thousands of pages of primary sources and writing over 100 pages of research and creative analysis. The aim of the ATW professors is to prepare the students to solve complex issues by guiding them through a multidisciplinary curriculum that will sharpen and expand the students' intellectual capacity.
