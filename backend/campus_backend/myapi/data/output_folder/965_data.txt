Q&A with Catherine

Where are you from?
I was born and raised in Ventura County, California.

What did you study in college?
I majored in Behavioral Science and minored in Social Work.

What is your favorite place to eat in Irvine?
CAVA is my all-time favorite! It is like Chipotle for Greek food. Overall, you can’t go wrong! Orange County food is SO good.

What do you like to do with your free time?
I love playing pickleball, watching Survivor with my husband, doing escape rooms with friends, and taking as many beach trips as possible!

What advice do you have for students going through the admissions process?
Your college experience won’t look like anyone else’s! Don’t compare it to what your older sibling or friend’s college might look like. Trust your gut and you’ll find the school that best suits YOU. Don’t be afraid to ask questions! People want to support you and give you clarity during this process.
