Curriculum

Concordia is, without a doubt, a rich atmosphere in which to ascend as a performing musician. A dedication to the Performance concentration will place the most challenging repertoire in front of students through rigorous one-on-one training with a highly accomplished professional performer as well as numerous ensemble performances that include expectations of musical leadership. Concordia graduates who have moved on to graduate school regularly comment that Concordia's performance atmosphere is richer than large schools for musician development because the strongest young undergraduates have opportunities to rise to principal chairs sooner while being challenged with a heavy, diverse performing schedule that is rare for undergraduates at many of the large music schools with many graduate students. When entering graduate school, they feel like more seasoned performers than their peers who attended brand name music schools.

For those with a heightened degree of dedication and concentration, Concordia can be an ideal training ground for a musical performer. However, it is rare for musicians to make the majority of their income as performers. Concordia will prepare students to perform with professional-level standards in an exceptional academic environment, which could propel students to graduate study, and which likely will propel them to become professors, teachers, and music directors who are best attuned to the highest standards in music.  Their achievements in collegiate music performance will provide a level of self-discipline, work ethic, and ability to complete difficult problem-solving tasks that is desperately sought after in any professional environment.
