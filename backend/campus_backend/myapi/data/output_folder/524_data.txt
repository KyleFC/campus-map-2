This course will equip students with knowledge and skills to understand and practice their role as leaders in a climate of change. An emphasis will be placed on applying leadership and organizational theory to build and sustain cultures of learning. Additional emphasis will be given to the role of leadership in setting the moral example, fostering a caring environment, and developing a community of learners respectful of all members and differences. Students will assess their leadership traits and styles, evaluate their strengths and weaknesses, and identify areas in need of improvement. Research skills will be strengthened through the evaluation and annotation of primary sources on such topics as whole system reform, coherence building, systems thinking, leadership, organizational planning and learning.


EDD 702: Building Capacity for Learning and Continuous Improvement
3

This course immerses students in an in-depth exploration of three leadership modesÃ¢â¬â instructional, adaptive, and transformationalÃ¢â¬âto create capacity for learning and continuous improvement. Through the examination of these modes, students will further their understanding, skills and competencies to ensure quality learning systems, cultivate a high-performing organization, foster continuous improvement, inspire a shared vision, model cultural responsiveness, and sustain inclusive learning communities. Research skills will be strengthened through the evaluation and annotation of primary sources on such topics as capacity building, leadership, and learning organizations, among other topics. Students will also create a personal philosophy and leadership development plan to demonstrate their own commitment to continuous learning and improvement.


EDD 706: Policy, Law and Practice in Dynamic Settings
3

This course will provide students with insight into the development of, response to, and ability to influence the larger political, social, economic, legal, and cultural contexts impacting organizations and practices. Specific emphasis will be given to standards, policies, and entities presently guiding decisions at national, state, and local levels. The course provides a rich history of the political aspects inherent to policy and how these policies transverse from the federal government to state and local levels. Group travel to Washington D.C. to meet with governmental officials will be incorporated into this course.


EDD 707: Change Forces in Diverse Settings
3

This course will provide students insight and knowledge into the challenges and complexities of intercultural communication in the global context. The course engages students in the process of reflective, critical thinking and acting to enable them to navigate in complex and dynamic intercultural environments and educational settings. Specific emphasis is placed on knowledge and skills necessary for cross-cultural interpersonal and group communication that reflects a commitment to respect for other cultures and an ability to communicate with diverse audiences. Central to the course is the idea that understanding of cultures is essential to leading diverse learning organizations in a rapidly changing and mobile world. The course concludes with an examination of how changing culture in systemic ways can lead to successful reform. International Research Trip or Experiential Learning Practicum is embedded within this course.


DISSERTATION RESEARCH
EDD 771-772A & 775-775C: Dissertation Seminars
2

Dissertation Seminar 1 serves as an orientation to the initial stages of the dissertation seminar process.  This seminar will focus on identification of a potential research topic, conducting a broad scan of the literature, reviewing, summarizing, and classifying annotated sources, and mastering the academic writing style (American Psychological Association).  Students will be provided with an overview of dissertation topics and sample dissertation proposals. The seminar will also reference work done on the Annotated Bibliography Benchmark Assessments. 

Dissertation Seminar 2 will build on the information covered in Dissertation Seminar 1 with the final outcomes of the seminar to be the development of a prospectus and focused review of literature (i.e., annotated bibliography) for the preliminary dissertation proposal.  In this seminar students focus on annotating and evaluating sources and narrowing a researchable topic, while beginning the process of identifying a theoretical framework and preliminary research method. Attention will be given to identifying problem statements and research questions that can guide their progress toward completion of the preliminary dissertation proposal.  Students build upon the Annotated Bibliography and Preliminary Literature Review Benchmark Assessments to move students toward an initial outline for the preliminary dissertation proposal. 

Dissertation Seminar 5 parallels EDD 791 (a-c) to provide doctoral candidates further direction and strategies in implementing the comprehensive dissertation proposal, addressing challenges that arise in the collection and analysis of data, organizing and writing chapter 4 and chapter 5 of the final dissertation document, and preparing for the dissertation oral defense as outlined in the doctoral student handbook. Candidates will also attend and participate in a professional conference to gain a complete understanding of the research process and to promote networking among professionals.

EDD 773-774B: Dissertation Advisement
1.5

Dissertation Advisements serve as a time for students to focus on scholarly writing skills and the development of a problem statement and a preliminary chapter two and chapter 3 of the dissertation proposal. Important during these advisements will be the student’s identification of a theoretical framework and the kinds of references they will need to continue to gather for the literature review.  Initially students build on the Annotated Bibliography and Preliminary Literature Review Benchmarks toward developing broader understanding of their research ideas related to the literature. Each student is assigned a dissertation committee chair to direct the student through the dissertation track process and to provide feedback on drafts of student written work. 

Also during Dissertation Advisements, students will focus on the development of the preliminary methodology chapter for the preliminary dissertation proposal and on the development and alignment of research questions to research methods described in the chapter.  Students will be guided on the collection and analysis of data, both quantitatively and qualitatively, to lead them to the answering of their research questions, based on skills that have been developed through the Research Benchmarks: Quantitative Research Plan and Qualitative Research Plan.  Each student will also receive feedback from her or his chair and research course instructor on drafts of chapter one (problem statement, purpose of the study, & research questions) and chapter three of the preliminary dissertation proposal. EDD 774b Dissertation Advisement serves as a time to develop a mixed methods research design from previous work conducted for the Quantitative Research Plan and Qualitative Research Plan.  Time is also devoted to writing, review, revision, and approval of the preliminary dissertation proposal. Moreover, students will be provided with direction in developing a detailed timeline leading them to successful completion of the next stages of the dissertation process.

EDD 781-791C: Dissertation
12

During the dissertation proposal and research phases, the doctoral candidate engages in a number of activities and tasks to fulfill the requirements of the dissertation track.

A doctoral student may need additional time to complete the preliminary dissertation proposal, under the guidance of the student’s Dissertation Seminar 4 professor.  Once approved by the seminar professor and Doctoral Office, the doctoral candidate is assigned to a dissertation chair and committee. 

Under the direction of the dissertation chair and working with committee members, the doctoral candidate develops the final version of the comprehensive dissertation proposal including the problem statement, literature review, and research design. The candidate will also receive training and gain certification on the institutional review board (IRB) approval process at Concordia and submit proposals to the IRB. During this time the candidate also prepares for the oral defense of the dissertation proposal and work with the dissertation chair to schedule the oral defense of the proposal. 

Dissertation research involves the implementation of the dissertation research design, collection and analysis of data, and reporting and discussion of research findings.  Each doctoral candidate will execute the research design, follow the dissertation proposal timeline, collect and analyze data related to dissertation research questions, work with the dissertation chair to discuss the execution of the dissertation research plan and progress made on data collection and analysis, organize and write drafts of chapters 4 and 5 of the dissertation, and prepare for the dissertation oral defense as outlined in the doctoral student handbook. Dissertation research culminates in the successful completion of the dissertation and dissertation oral defense.
