ncluding three on athletic scholarship at the University of Oregon.

During my three year stay at Cypress High School, I took a non-competitive team and made a winning competitive program, qualifying for finals at USA Nationals in each of those three years.

In my first year at OBU, I took a team that was not representative of the type program the school desired and returned them to the level of excellence expected. In the only STUNT games we played (at the University of the Ozarks), we won both games.

Biography

The longest tenured coach in Concordia University Irvine history, Ken Ammann enters his 21st year as head coach of the CUI Eagles men’s basketball program in the fall of 2021.

Concordia's attacking and aggressive style of play has helped Ammann's teams win two NAIA National Championships in four NAIA National Championship appearances. During his tenure, the Eagles have averaged 26 wins a season over the past two decades and he owns an overall record of 486-172 (.739 winning percentage). Ammann was also the first 400-game winner in Concordia coaching history among all sports.

Since taking over in 2001, Ammann has helped the Eagles win at least 20 games in 16 of his 20 seasons at the helm. His Concordia teams have posted 30 victories in a season six times and have never finished a full season below .500. Prior to his arrival, the program had experienced just eight winning campaigns since its inception in 1981.

The former Stanford basketball player has been named the NAIA Coach of the Year twice. He was the recipient of the 2020 Harry Statham Coach of Impact Award, which honors head coaches at the small college level that display high character and integrity while serving as excellent role models who have deeply impacted the lives of others.

Ammann has transformed the Concordia men’s basketball program into one of the top non-Division I programs in the country, turning Concordia into a national power nearly overnight. He and his coaching staff were an integral part of Concordia making a smooth transition from NAIA to NCAA Division II over the past few years.

The 2018-2019 campaign saw the Eagles fly to new heights as they reached the NCAA DII Tournament for the first time in school history after receiving an at-large bid in the west regional bracket. CUI also advanced to the PacWest Conference Championship Game for the first time in program history. Ammann's squad asserted itself as a major player by going 12-1 at home and a perfect 11-0 against PacWest opponents at CU Arena on its way to a second place finish in the conference. CUI finished just one game behind Point Loma in the conference standings and defeated the eventual DII national runner-ups in an overtime thriller in front of a packed house during the regular season. The Green and Gold ultimately finished the year with a 23-11 overall record and an impressive 18-4 conference mark. Senior guard Brian Chambers led the entire PacWest in steals, finished third in scoring (17.7 ppg) and was named First Team All-PacWest, while center Geoff Gerlach received All-PacWest Honorable Mention and versatile forward Kayle Knuckles was named PacWest Freshman of the Year.

The 2017-2018 campaign marked Concordia’s first season of postseason eligibility since completing the transition to Division II. Ammann helped the Eagles secure their first berth in the PacWest Conference Tournament after the team posted a 19-10 regular season mark with a 12-8 league record. Ammann’s squad earned the fifth seed in the tourney and then collected the school’s first-ever PacWest Conference Tournament victory when the Eagles defeated Point Loma, 69-65. Concordia then closed out the season with a 20-11 overall record after Dixie State knocked out the Eagles in the semifinal round.

In their first season of NCAA Division II competition (2015-16), the Eagles went 22-7 overall and tied for first in the PacWest Conference at 15-5. The following season, Ammann’s squad finished fifth in the league with a 17-11 overall record and a 12-8 conference mark as the school continued its 3-year transition from NAIA.

During the 2014-2015 campaign, Ammann led the Eagles to a 27-8 overall record and 13-3 conference record in the Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC). The Eagles capped off that season with their 11th trip to the NAIA National Tournament in 14 years.

Ammann was named the 2011-2012 NAIA National Coach of the Year for the second time in his career after leading the Eagles to the 2012 National Championship. Concordia defeated Oklahoma Baptist 72-69 in Kansas City, Missouri to claim the program's second national title.

Ammann also led the Green and Gold to the NAIA finals in 2007 and 2004 where the Eagles finished as NAIA runner-up.

In only his second season (2002-03), Ammann led the Eagles to their first NAIA National Championship in school history. Concordia outlasted Mountain State in overtime by a count
