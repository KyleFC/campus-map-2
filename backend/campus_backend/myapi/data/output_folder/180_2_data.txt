Concordia's Q&I Core is rich in both educational traditions of the West and new explorations of the traditions of the wider world. Concordia's Q&I Core provides both disciplinary and interdisciplinary means of education, grounded in the Western, secular and Judeo-Christian, intellectual and spiritual developments, that will allow students to reach out from the West to works, faiths, and traditions around the world. The Q&I Core courses are remindful of the great courses in Literature, Humanities and Civilization that have been offered to students at some of the finest universities in the land.

Q&I Core Courses for Transfer Students

A unique pairing of philosophy and theology Core courses has been designed for students transferring with 30 or more semester units. They will explore the question of what it means to be human.
