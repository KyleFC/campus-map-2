The Beach

Our campus is located in the Southern California city of Irvine. Not only is Irvine consistently ranked as one of the safest cities in America, it’s also ranked as one of the most desirable in which to live.

With a diverse population of more than 220,000 people, an average yearly temperature of 73°F and a thriving economy that attracts both startups and established businesses, it’s no wonder that Irvine has claimed a place of prominence on so many “best of” lists (like those created by MONEY, Forbes, The Daily Beast and Businessweek, just to name a few).

We're also just 6 miles from the Pacific Ocean and less than 30 miles from the Santa Ana Mountains. If you feel like getting off campus, we're also 90 minutes from San Diego; 60 minutes from Los Angeles; and 20 minutes from Disneyland.
