PATRONS OF THE ARTS

The Arts are at the heart of our university. Patrons of our Music, Theatre, and Visual Arts programs help sponsor student scholarships, purchase instruments and equipment, and fund improved learning facilities for our artists and performers.

EXPLORE 
Music Patrons

Music Patrons support the University in its effort to provide high-quality training for musicians and music educators of the future. The Patrons' contributions include sponsorship of scholarships, purchasing instruments and equipment, defraying student expenses for conferences and competitions, and funding other needs.

Theatre Patrons

The performing arts have been an integral part of the Concordia experience since the school's earliest days and the theatre programs have grown to require three fully-equipped performance spaces: the CU Center, the Studio Theatre, and the Nelson Outdoor Amphitheatre.

We are placing music, worship and theology at the heart of campus to create a place for study, creativity, reflection, adoration and passionate seeking with both head and heart.

Rev. Dr. Steve Mueller '86, Dean of Christ College

Together, letâ€™s build facilities that inspire learning
