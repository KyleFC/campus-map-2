Fly-in Reimbursement

To make it more feasible for prospective students to visit Concordia, we offer a one-time reimbursement of up to $500* for your own flight to visit us on campus.

You must be enrolled as a full-time undergraduate student through the first two weeks of the semester you start at CUI to be eligible for reimbursement.
The reimbursement program applies to an individual campus visit or event coordinated by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions prior to the start of the semester. It does not apply to travel for move-in day or the start of school.
Please purchase your flight upon confirmation of your visit by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.

Important: To make the most of your visit, please speak with your admissions counselor before purchasing your flight.

*Due to NCAA legislation, prospective student-athletes may not be eligible for this one-time reimbursement. If you have any questions, please contact your Head Coach or the Associate Athletic Director for Compliance.
