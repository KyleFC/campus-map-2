Secure the Concordia experience
The Business of Giving Back - Chris ’04 and Katherine Pond ’05

Investing in the Annual Fund and student scholarships gives Concordia the flexibility to direct your donation to where it is needed most – benefiting our students through financial aid, technology, lab equipment, research opportunities and much more.

In partnership we can offer accessible and affordable education to students. Annual Gifts can be designated to fund the elements that defined your CUI experience or support need-based scholarships to help others define theirs.
