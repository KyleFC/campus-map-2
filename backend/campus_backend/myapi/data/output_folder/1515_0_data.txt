CURRICULUM
Master's in Coaching & Athletics Administration

In other graduate programs we realized there was a big gap between the learning and the doing. So within our MA or MS program, we cover a broader spectrum from middle school to collegiate-level curriculum, offer summer intensives where you can focus your training, and include a course to guide you through building a professional portfolio.

Master of Arts or Master of Science?

The nationally renowned Master of Arts in Coaching and Athletics Administration (MCAA) program has expanded to offer a Master of Science degree. Both degrees are part of the MCAA program at Concordia University Irvine.

Master of Arts

A Master of Arts degree option focuses on the practical application of knowledge in the academic discipline of coaching and athletics administration. This option has been in existence since 2005 and is uniquely designed for working professionals.

The Master of Arts program offers a wide variety of elective opportunities. These opportunities include sport specific courses designed to ensure academic and professional expertise in coaching and athletics administration.

One distinctive element of the Master of Arts program is the opportunity to participate in an internship â€“ a supervised educational work experience that allows you to apply the theories of what you are learning in a practical setting.

Master of Science

A Master of Science degree option incorporates the exercise sciences into the curriculum. Earning the Master of Science will expand employment opportunities for MCAA graduates to advance their careers in positions that require a science-based degree.

Consult your MCAA academic advisor to find out which degree program works best for you.

MCAA graduates who previously earned an M.A. can now earn the Master of Science to advance their careers in positions that require a science-based degree.

Building on the 16 units of core courses that you already completed to earn your M.A., you will only need to complete 16 additional elective units and a 4-unit enhanced portfolio (you will not need to start over for your culminating project) to earn your M.S. All coursework can be completed fully online in as little as 9 months. Start dates for the M.S. program operate under the same quarterly time-frames. As an added benefit, alumni applying for the Master of Science will have the application fee waived.
