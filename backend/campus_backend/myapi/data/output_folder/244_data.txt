Transfer Out Request: F-1 Students

F-1 international student intending to transfer to another college or university must use this form to notify PDSO at the Office of Global Programs (OGP). The information requested on this form is required by Concordia University Irvine in order to release your SEVIS I-20 Form record to another institution. Please submit this completed form along with a letter of admission from the institution to which you intend to transfer.

The earliest SEVIS transfer release date will be the end of the current semester (or Session) at Concordia unless you can document the need for an earlier date. Once the transfer-out process is complete, your Concordia I-20 will no longer be valid. It is your responsibility to contact your transfer-in school regarding procedures for obtaining a new I-20.

NOTE: The SEVIS transfer-out request will not be processed until PDSO/DSO receives a copy of your official admission letter from the school you will attend. Submit a copy of your official admission letter to rachel.kim3@cui.edu
