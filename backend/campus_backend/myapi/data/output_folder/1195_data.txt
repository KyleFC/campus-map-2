Put Your Love of Reading to Use

For history buffs and book nerds, these two volunteer opportunities won’t even feel like work. With Smithsonian Transcribers, you can transcribe images of historical documents, including field notes, diaries, ledgers, logbooks, photo albums, and manuscripts, into digital form to help make this data more accessible. And with Bookshare—which created a library that makes reading easier for people with dyslexia, blindness, cerebral palsy, and other reading barriers—you can scan textbooks, best sellers, children’s books, and career resources or proofread and format scans that others have made.

‌
Research and Expose Human Rights Violations

Amnesty International’s Amnesty Decoders program gamifies and crowdsources research. Using your computer or phone, you’ll sift through photos, information, and documents and answer simple questions to help identify human rights violations. Past projects have included analyzing Tweets about female politicians in India for abusive language; using satellite imagery of remote villages in Darfur to find evidence that they’d been attacked; and verifying investigation reports about oil spills in the Niger Delta to find false or misleading information.

‌
Run Errands for Immunocompromised Neighbors

You don't have to be affiliated with an organization to help your community. Running errands for elderly or vulnerable neighbors is one of the best ways to make a difference. Many people who cannot leave their homes are not just in need of food -- they may also need toiletries, to have a prescription picked up, or a package delivered to the post office.

Volunteer Online for the United Nations

Much like the American Red Cross, the United Nations (U.N.) has myriad volunteer needs that can be done remotely. Its online platform matches volunteers with U.N. partner organizations that are ending poverty, building peace, advancing gender equality, and more for roles that include outreach and advocacy, research, teaching and training, technology development, and administration.
