Health and Safety Guidelines

Commencement plans will be in compliance with public health guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control, the State of California, and Orange County. We want to ensure the health and well-being of our Concordia community and commencement guests are a top priority.

A face covering must be worn by all commencement attendees, both indoors and outdoors, and physical distance guidelines will be maintained.
Guests will have their temperature taken at the gatehouse before entering campus.
We kindly ask that guests and graduates use discretion when considering attending, and follow CDC guidelines for health screening and travel.
Decorum & Celebration Policies
Gown length and style may not be altered. Stoles may not be customized in any way.
Modest personal embellishments are allowed on the cap, but MUST lay flat, cannot extend over the edge, and must be appropriate.
Only CUI-approved regalia (including pins, stoles, cords, and medallions) bestowed at the Undergraduate Academic Achievement ceremony and provided by university-sponsored clubs or CUI Veterans Resource Center may be worn at graduation. Decorative items such as costume leis, beads, or sashes may only be worn after the ceremony.
Balloons, alcohol, glass, noisemakers, firearms, and weapons are not permitted on campus.
Guest Assistance

If your guests require assistance, such as a wheelchair or walker, please let them know they must bring their own. Our walk-through Commencement event and activities will be solely standing and walking, no sitting, so please plan accordingly. Golf cart rides will be provided for guests who need assistance.

One Vehicle Limit

Due to limited parking availability and venue capacity restrictions, graduates will be issued one parking pass prior to commencement. Only one vehicle per graduate will be permitted. Your vehicle must fit into a standard size parking stall (no RVs, limos, party-busses, etc.). The one-vehicle limit will be strictly enforced; additional vehicles and those without the parking pass will be turned away at the gatehouse. Student transponders will be shut off on the day of Commencement to accommodate the traffic flow. Exceedingly large groups may not be able to enter the venue all at once.

Livestream Options

For friends and relatives who cannot attend in person, the Commencement ceremony on May 8, 2021 will be live-streamed. A link will be made available on the day of the ceremony.

This page is frequently updated as additional information becomes available from the Commencement Committee. Please note that all Commencement events are subject to change in accordance with local, state, and federal guidelines regarding COVID-19. Please contact graduation@cui.edu with your commencement questions.
