ask Guidelines Extended

September 16, 2021

Greetings to our CUI Students and Employees!

Update to Mask Guidelines on Campus

Our campus community has continued to see a low, but steady number of positive COVID-19 cases since the Labor Day holiday weekend. There is also a steady but slow trend downward in cases in Orange County. If our campus and county infection numbers continue to trend downward, we are optimistic that indoor mask requirements can be relaxed by early October.

In order to keep up progress toward bringing transmission rates lower, current campus mask guidance will be extended through October 1, 2021. All employees, students, and campus guests, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, are to continue to wear face coverings in all indoor campus settings.

As a reminder, there are limited exceptions to the mask guidelines. Resident students are not required to wear a mask within the student’s residence hall room. No student will be required to wear a mask for athletics practices, or co-curricular activities such as instrumental and vocal ensemble rehearsals, forensics rehearsals, theatre rehearsals, etc. Faculty who are fully vaccinated will not be required to wear a mask while teaching in the front of the classroom. Students who are fully vaccinated may remove their masks while presenting in front of the class. Masks may be removed when eating in the cafeteria and Eagles’ Landing, but should be on while going through line or returning to the serving areas.

COVID-19 on Campus

Concordia’s campus COVID-19 cases are regularly updated on CUI’s COVID-19 Dashboard. The Dashboard website also lists information about vaccine resources, symptom checking, and testing.

We will continue to monitor the cases on campus and in Orange County, and the indoor campus mask mandate will be reevaluated prior to October 1, 2021.

Campus Update: Preparing for Fall 2021

August 11, 2021

Dear CUI Students and Families,

This email contains important information concerning updated mask guidelines on campus, reminders about uploading vaccination information, and a NEW requirement of pre-arrival COVID-19 testing for residential students. Please read this information carefully so that you are prepared for your arrival on campus in the days ahead.

Update to Mask Guidelines on Campus

Due to the rise of COVID-19 cases in Orange County and throughout the nation, and out of an abundance of caution, the campus community, regardless of vaccination status, will be required to wear masks or face coverings in indoor settings. This applies to all employees, students, and guests. 

This new campus guidance will go into effect on Friday, August 20, at the start of S.O.A.R (new student Orientation) and will be in place through Labor Day on Monday, September 6. The requirement will be reevaluated every two weeks thereafter during the Fall 2021 semester. 

Why? We do this to care for one another and protect the health of our student and employee population. The CDC currently rates Orange County as a “high transmission” area. By asking everyone to wear masks, regardless of vaccination status, we give our community more time to be fully vaccinated as we come together from all over the nation and internationally. Many of our students, including nursing students (per CA State guidance) and student-athletes (per NCAA guidance), will be required to wear masks in many indoor settings.
