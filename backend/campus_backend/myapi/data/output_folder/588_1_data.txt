ALUMNI ASSOCIATION

Meet Our Alumni
This program has afforded me a deeper relationship with Jesus Christ, a deeper relationship with my wife and kids, and also a deeper relationship with my athletes and colleagues…I have learned what it means to truly invest time, effort, and energy into these different relationships and have grown closer to each group/person throughout this program.
