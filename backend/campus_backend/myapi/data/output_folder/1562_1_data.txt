Widor - Salvum fac populum tuum (CWO and organ)

This sequence was performed without applause or commentary. Upon completion, we received extremely warm ovations from our audiences and followed with encores of folk music from the Netherlands and U.S., and closed with Sousa’s Hands Across the Sea, performed antiphonally between the CWO and the organ. Read the full concert program, with program notes.

The St. Nicholas Basilica Concert

Venues:

June 8: Laurenskerk, Rotterdam
This church dates to the 15th century, and was frequented by Erasmus, one of the most influential theologians of the Reformation era. In WWII, the entire city center of Rotterdam was flattened by a Nazi blitzkrieg. Only the wall of the Laurenskerk remained standing. Since then, the church has been reconstructed to new glory, including the largest pipe organ in the Netherlands. It was an outstanding venue for the expansive sounds of the wind orchestra, solo voices, and of course the magnificent organ.

June 9: St. Nicholas and St. Antony’s Catholic Church, Monnickendam
One of the two main churches in this medieval fishing village.

June 10: St. Nicholas Basilica, Amsterdam
We closed our tour at the Basilica, one of Amsterdam’s most recognizable landmarks. This spectacular church continues to utilize its 19th century Sauer organ - one of the most admired organs in the world. It was very moving to perform in this space, particularly since the pews were packed with audience members.
