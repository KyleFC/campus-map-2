Applicants must satisfy the following criteria and complete all submission requirements to be considered for acceptance into the MA in Educational Leadership Program:

Bachelor’s degree or higher from a regionally accredited institution
Online application
$50 non-refundable application fee
Official copies of highest degree-granting institution transcripts
Cumulative GPA of 2.75 or higher
Students with International Transcripts

ALL non-US equivalent transcripts must arrive with a certified English evaluation and translation, and evidence of degree posted. The student must have a minimum GPA of 2.75 on a 4.0 scale, or equivalent to that according to the grading system used by the country that a student is applying from.

Please note that Concordia University Irvine does not have a translation or evaluation service, and students are responsible to get an official translation and evaluation done by a NACES-approved evaluation agency verifying the equivalent of a regionally accredited U.S. bachelor's degree or higher – Concordia University Irvine prefers international transcripts to be evaluated through IERF.

Please ask for a Detail Report (also known as a course-by-course report)
