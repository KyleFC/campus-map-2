About Us

The School of Education has a rich tradition of training teachers. We have graduates teaching literally around the world as a part of our mission to go into the world and serve. Our graduates are recognized as outstanding in their field.

Training teachers was an original goal when the school first opened as Christ College, Irvine in 1976. Formal recognition of the School of Education as one of only three schools within Concordia University was not until 1995. Since our humble beginnings, we have had thousands of teachers in our undergraduate and graduate programs move into careers in education.

We currently serve over one thousand graduate and undergraduate students on campus, online, and in our regional cohorts in Temecula, Orange County, Los Angeles County and the Inland Empire.

Concordia Universityâ€™s credential programs meet all requirements put forth by the state of California and are approved by the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Additionally, Concordia University is accredited by the Accrediting Commission for Senior Colleges and Universities of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, (WASC).
