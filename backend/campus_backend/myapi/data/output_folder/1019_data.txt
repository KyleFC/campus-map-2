Marketing Approval Policy
STUDENT LEADERSHIP
Concordia University Irvine Marketing "Must-Know's"

ASCUI Communications Director: Natalie Annunziato (ASCUI.Comm@cui.edu)
Mission & Purpose: To maintain university integrity through a Christ-like manner via communication.

General Marketing Guidelines (Online & Print)
Basics:
All advertisements must be relevant to Concordia University Irvine
All advertisements must be neat, professional, in color, and visually appealing
All advertisements must include:
Event name
The organization sponsoring the event
Location
Date
Time with "a.m." or "p.m."
(if applicable):
Prices
Bus availability
Groups invited (if not open to all Concordia students)
All print advertisements must not contain any spelling or grammatical errors
All print advertisements must be hung up using blue tape (provided by the CSLD Front Desk) on the back of the paper, not showing from the front
For breezeway posters, see CSLD Front Desk for help when hanging up

**Profanity, offensive language, the promotion of the illegal use of alcohol/drugs, or any violations of the federal/state law, and school policies/conduct codes is not permissible.

Important Things to Keep in Mind
To ensure that Concordia students, faculty and staff are “in the know” with what events are going on, it is suggested that you submit your marketing request 2-3 weeks in advance of the event (may vary depending on magnitude of event) so news of the event can have adequate time to spread
This is an overlooked, but vital aspect to better turnouts because more times than not, people do not know that events are taking place due to lack of timely marketing
Submitting requests this far in advance allows time for scheduling, printing, and posting advertisements
Print Advertisements must be taken down within 48 hours of the end of your event. If the event has no end date, update information every 2 weeks
Includes posters, sandwich boards, etc.
