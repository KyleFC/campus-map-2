2024 Hispanic Leadership Conference
A college road map for community college & high school students

Concordia University Irvine’s 7th Hispanic Leadership Conference for community college and high school students.

MAR

13

Wednesday, March 13, 2020
8:00 AM - 1:30 PM

Since 2016, this FREE event has been inspiring community college and high school students to pursue academic goals for a bright future. The purpose of this event is to help attendees navigate the path to college. Students will discover that college is not a dream, it’s a plan. The conference offers a toolkit of educational resources about college majors, financial aid, as well as inspiring first-generation speakers, industry professionals, and a keynote. Parents can also join their own breakout session—in Spanish/en español—that offers valuable resources on what to expect as their child begins their college journey. The conference ends with a free lunch and a college Information Fair.
