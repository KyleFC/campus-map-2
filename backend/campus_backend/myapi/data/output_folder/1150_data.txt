Concordia Summer Music

Concordia's summer music programs provide supplemental music education in an excellence-focused Christian atmosphere. Our instructors include college music professors and professional performers with excellent credentials. A certificate from a Concordia Summer Music Program is a strong indication that a student is taking extra steps to achieve as a musician.

Most activities take place in the Borland-Manske Center, one of Southern California's premium music learning centers. The building opened in 2019, and utilizes very high standards for air ventilation. It is one of the healthiest buildings for music-making in the area.

Please note that, as long as the pandemic continues to persist, mitigation procedures are in effect in accordance with county regulations. Any offerings in summer 2024 are planned to be able to work within those standards. Please note that conditions, policies, and the ability to hold summer music events are subject to change at any time.
