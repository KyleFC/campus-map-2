 You will also enlist an editor to review your writing and make suggestions for improvements. Details can be found in our handbook.

The real benefit is realized when you’re ready to level up and you walk into your interview ready. Over and over we hear how our students had a leg up on their competition because they were the only ones in the room with a portfolio of their work and achievements.

Internships

Leverage the MCAA program to gain experience through our MA Internship. Apply your graduate-level training to a job situation while earning elective credits. Here’s what one of our recent grads had to say:

Going into the season, I was interested in learning whether or not I could see myself coaching for the rest of my life. I knew what kind of work, love and dedication it would take, but I had yet to experience a complete season as a coach. Through this experience, I can now confidently say that I will pursue baseball coaching as a career. There is no doubt in my mind that coaching is what I want to do for the rest of my life.

— Collin Radack, Spring 2017
