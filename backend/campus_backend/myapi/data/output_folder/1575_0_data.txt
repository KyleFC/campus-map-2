Concordia's annual Christmas Concert tradition returned to the Renée and Henry Segerstrom Concert Hall to celebrate the Christmas season with the voices and instruments of Concordia University Irvine. Concordia’s critically-acclaimed choirs, handbells and orchestra shared glad tidings of great joy--Christ was born to save! The theme for 2021, "Repeat the Sounding Joy!" showcased more than 200 performers from eight vocal and instrumental performing ensembles under the masterful direction of Dr. Michael Busch and Dr. Jeff Held.

A new made-for-TV special episode of “Repeat the Sounding Joy: A Concordia Christmas” was filmed for PBS in the Borland-Manske Center and aired during the week of Christmas.

Rejoice!

The Christmas season is a time for joy and a time for hope in celebrating Jesus' birth. We began the season with our Advent devotions and concluded with our annual Christmas concert.

All is Bright!
A Concordia Christmas

An encore performance of our Christmas special, "All is Bright: A Concordia Christmas," aired on national PBS affiliates throughout the country in the month of December.

The made-for-TV Christmas concerts featured music produced in the recording studios of Concordia University Irvine’s newest building, the Borland-Manske Center, as well as footage from a 2018 Concordia concert at Segerstrom Hall. The narrated special includes arrangements of favorite Christmas carols by students, soloists, as well as Americana, jazz, and commercial ensembles. Concordia’s choirs, orchestras, and handbells also performed.
