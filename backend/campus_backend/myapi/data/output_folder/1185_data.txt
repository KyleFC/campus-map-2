Why We Serve
Mariners Church
CONCORDIA serves

In our Food Pantry, we distribute bags of shelf-stable food, fresh produce, protein, and dairy to families in need while making a personal connection to walk alongside them in their journey towards self-sufficiency. We seek to help meet the tangible and physical needs of our recipients while introducing them to Jesus, who is the true Bread of Life and Living Water.

 Tuesday, September 26, 2023, 10:00Â am - 1:00 pm
