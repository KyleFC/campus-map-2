Campus Activities
2000 – present. Provide several extra-curricular opportunities for students to interact with theological issues, current events and each other. “Cinema Sophia” offers a movie each week for viewing. The film is followed by analysis and discussion, focused on the relationship between the intent of the film and philosophical/theological principles. “Great Books Conversation” is a lunch time group that considers excerpts from the world’s greatest literature. “Concordians for Concord among Concordians” meets each week over lunch to allow students to pursue questions they have of any nature, but particularly those which generate tension between various church workers and between those who claim a Christian belief system. “Apologetics Exercise” is a once a semester meeting of two student teams who oppose each other on a high profile issue. Practice in research, public speaking, but most of all, evangelical apologetic method is provided. The whole campus is invited to participate and attend.
