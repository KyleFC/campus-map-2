Mission Statement
Ka Puʻuhonua

Ka Puʻuhonua is the Hawaiian term for “the place of refuge.” It was chosen because of our mission to provide a safe space and family aspect for Concordia's Pacific Islander students and beyond. Concordia has a fairly large number of students from Hawai’i and our aim is to share all aspects of our beautiful Hawaiian culture with the rest of the students and faculty here, through food, language, and educational activities.
