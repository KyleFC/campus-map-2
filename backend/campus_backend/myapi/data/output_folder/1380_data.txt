Concordia Master Chorale

Dr. Michael Busch, conductor

The Concordia Master Chorale is a community chorus dedicated to excellence in the performance of sacred choral literature. They perform for thousands of people each year in the beautiful acoustics of the Concordia Center for Worship and Performing Arts. Their annual concert series includes a fall hymn festival with guest composer, the popular Concordia Christmas Concerts, and a MasterWorks Concert series with professional orchestra. Recent performances include such works as the Bach Mass in B Minor, Bernstein’s Chichester Psalms, Durufle’s Requiem, Mendelssohn’s Elijah, Mozart’s Requiem, Vaughan Williams’ Dona nobis pacem, and Bach’s St. Matthew Passion.

The Concordia Master Chorale performs under the direction of Dr. Michael Busch, who is beginning his twenty-third season with the ensemble. Dr. Busch serves as Director of Choral and Vocal Activities at Concordia University in Irvine, where he supervises the choral program of four choirs in addition to teaching choral methods, theory, and conducting.

Auditions for the ensemble are held each September and January. For more information, either call the Concordia Music Office at (949) 214-3423 or email at music@cui.edu.
