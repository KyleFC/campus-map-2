Loan Programs

Federal student loans are available to most students regardless of income and provide a range of repayment options. A loan is money that you must repay with interest under varying terms and conditions. While it is important to be cautious of irresponsible borrowing, loans are considered an integral part of a student's Financial Aid package. Please carefully review the different types of loans available below and consider each one as a viable option for financing a college education.

Learn more about how to manage your loans.

How Do I Apply for a Loan?
Complete the Direct PLUS Loan Application. Parents MUST sign in using their own FSA ID (Parent PLUS only)
Sign the MPN/Loan Agreement.
What if I'm not approved?

If you were initially declined for the PLUS loan you can either obtain an endorser (cosigner) or choose to appeal the reason you were declined.

Appeal

Select "Apply for Aid", then "Appeal Credit Decision" once logged into https://studentaid.gov/. You will receive an answer regarding your appeal within 7-10 business days of all required documentation for the appeal being received.

Endorser

If you elect to use an endorser, you must start by having the endorser get their own FSA IS. Once the endorser's FSA ID is active, they will log into the Studentaid.gov site and select "Apply for Aid", then "Endorse a PLUS Loan." The endorser must pass a credit check. If approved, they will be asked to note how much they are willing to endorse. The PLUS loan amount cannot exceed what the endorser is willing to guarantee. Finally, the parent borrower signs the Federal Direct PLUS a Loan Agreement (MPN). The endorser does not sign the Loan Agreement/MPN.

If no action is taken (Parent PLUS loans only)

Parent PLUS loans that remain in declined status will trigger the Financial Aid Office to offer the student an additional unsubsidized Stafford loan. Freshmen and sophomores (0-59.9 units) are eligible for up to $4,000.00. Juniors and seniors (60+ units) are eligible for up to $5,000.00.
