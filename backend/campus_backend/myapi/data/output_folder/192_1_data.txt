What would you like to do?

There are two phases you complete as you pursue your calling to become a teacher. In the first phase, you acquire essential subject matter knowledge as you complete your undergraduate bachelor’s degree. The second phase of your professional preparation for teaching involves pedagogy, or teaching skills. Completion of this phase prepares you to apply for your preliminary California Teaching Credential. Graduate degrees offer mastery of a concentration and the potential to advance your career. There are many paths to pursuing your calling as an educator; here are some of the most common routes students take at Concordia’s School of Education.

Teach at an Elementary School

In California, a person studying to be an elementary school teacher will work toward obtaining a Multiple Subject Teaching Credential. This credential allows you to teach the variety of subjects offered at elementary schools.

Liberal Studies is the major most students choose when pursuing their Multiple Subject Teaching Credential. This major will well prepare you for the state required California Subject Examination Test (CSET) for multiple subjects which is required for all teacher candidates in California.

Programs Offered:
Liberal Studies
Multiple Subject Credential
Teach at a Lutheran School

Through Christ College, CUI Lutheran Teacher programs prepare the student for teaching in Lutheran schools at either the primary or secondary level. Students teaching assignments will include both public school settings and Lutheran schools.

These students will then be certified, called and commissioned by The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod to teach in Lutheran schools and hold a Lutheran Teacher Certificate.

Programs Offered:
Multiple Subject Credential
Single Subject Credential

Teach at a Middle School

If you want to be a middle school teacher there are two paths you can pursue in California. It depends on the subjects you want to teach. Some middle school teachers teach a cluster of courses such as math, English, and social studies. This arrangement requires the teacher to hold a multiple subject credential. In this case, the best subject matter preparation for you would be to complete Concordia’s Liberal Studies Major.

Other middle school teachers teach a single subject like a high school teacher. If this is your goal you will pursue a single subject credential in your desired subject.

Programs Offered:
Liberal Studies

Single Subject Credential
Teach at a High School

In California a person studying to be a high school teacher will work toward obtaining a single subject credential. This credential allows you to teach a specific subject matter that you pursue as your major. Concordia has 9 majors that correlate to single subject credentials authorized by the state of California: Art, Biology, Chemistry, English, Exercise Sport Science (PE), History, Mathematics, Music, and Physics.

Credential coursework can be done as part of your undergraduate degree allowing you to finish your bachelor’s degree and credential at the same time. It will take 4, 4.5, or 5 years depending on the pace you set for becoming a teacher. To obtain your credential you will pursue one of the above majors at CUI, finish the credential coursework, and pass the state required tests including the California Subject Examination Test (CSET) for your major.

Programs Offered:
Single Subject Credential

The State approved Special Education program at Concordia is titled “Education Specialist: Mild/Moderate.” This special education credential authorizes the teacher candidate to teach students (K-22) with mild to moderate disabilities, including students identified with specific learning disabilities, mild-moderate intellectual disabilities, and other health impairments.

Because a special education teacher can work with students in all grade levels K22 you will want to have a broad foundation of academic content. A special education teacher must be a well-educated person that has both breadth and depth in the subject areas. Your undergraduate major can be from any background, but it is highly recommended that you have a degree in Liberal Studies.
