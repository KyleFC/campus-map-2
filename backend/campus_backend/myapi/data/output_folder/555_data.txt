Norton, John J.
(949) 214-3317
john.norton@cui.edu
Professor of English
Lead Faculty Around-the-World Semester
Biography

Dr. Norton teaches courses in Shakespearean drama, 18th-century British literature, and American literature. He also teaches in the English core curriculum. Although primarily a Shakespearean, Norton’s academic interests are wide, and he enjoys uncovering and analyzing the life in Shakespeare and other literature in his classes and in his writing. Norton’s articles have appeared in Shakespeare, Early Modern Literary Studies, and Continuum Renaissance Drama. His most recent book (2018), Killing Physicians: Shakespeare's Blind Heroes and Reformation Saints (New Reformation Press), explores the influence of Reformation theology on Shakespeare's tragedies and late plays.

Norton is one of the leaders and developers of the Around-the-World Semester. He and his family- wife Erica, sons Jack and Sheffield, and daughter Naomi- launched and helped lead ATW teams in 2010, 2012, and 2014. Through his work with the ATW semester, Norton has helped to design the Global Cultural Studies Minor and the International Studies Major.

Some of Dr. Norton’s fondest memories at Concordia are from his years as head coach of the men's and women's tennis teams, 2005-2010.
