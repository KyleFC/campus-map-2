of students' university records. FERPA stipulates that only your student has access to his CUI records and that you may view them only with their written permission.

In accordance with FERPA, all correspondence from the University regarding grades, academic honors, and/or discipline is sent directly to your student at the address they list with the Registrar. As a parent, our advice for you is to consistently foster and maintain open lines of communication with your child. Let them know that you will be supportive regardless of the circumstances.

If you would like, you may also contact an academic advisor. While the advisors cannot discuss your childâ€™s grades with you, they are always happy to discuss general University policies with parents.

My student needs to notify their professors that they are ill. How do they do this?

If your child is well enough, they should email or call their professors to explain the situation and to obtain any work they are capable of doing. If they are too ill to contact their professors, you may contact your student's academic advisor.
