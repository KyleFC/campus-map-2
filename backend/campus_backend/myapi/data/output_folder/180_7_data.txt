nse of the universe, understand how it operates, and help us understand our place in it. A “wise, honorable, and cultivated citizen” needs to be aware of worldview and how it affects one’s view of the natural (and the supernatural) world. To ponder all that is real, one must ask and answer hard questions that continue to vex us, questions such as: What is truth? What is science? How do faith and science relate? Can I know the reality of God like the reality of the atom? How should humanity interact with nature? Courses that explore these (and other related) questions will help students know why they believe what they know about nature and how to articulate their thoughts in an educated manner.

This course will provide an introduction to the physical sciences in the context of physical oceanography along with the basic concepts of physics and chemistry including properties of water, ocean currents, heat budget, nutrient cycling, ocean-atmosphere interaction, El Niño-Southern Oscillation, oceanic waves, and tidal cycles. Lab time is included in the schedule along with field trips during lab time and up to two (2) weekend field trips. This course fulfills Q&I general education. Offered alternate years (odd years, fall semester).
Who Am I and Who Are They?

The exploration of this question analyzes the complex, dynamic interplay between self and other. Living in a good society requires citizens to be “wise, honorable, and cultivated” by closely examining how individuals think about, construct, act upon, and relate to one another. Courses that explore this question concentrate on the dialectic between “self” and “other” underscoring the various historical, economic, political, cultural, and social forces that shape both “I” and “they,” as well as the tensions that exist between the two.
