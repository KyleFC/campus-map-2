According to the U.S. Department of Education, there are nearly 500 colleges and universities designated as HSIs in the United States and Puerto Rico, and about 300 considered emerging HSIs, meaning they’re close to reaching the 25 percent threshold.

Hispanic Conference Leadership Alums

Concordia University Irvine alumni, as well as community members, who have participated as keynotes, speakers, or panelists in Concordia’s Hispanic Leadership Conference through the years are referred to as “conference alums.” This family of high-profile first-generation college-grad professionals pour into future first-gen college students, by sharing their journeys, remembering where they came from, and the sacrifices that their parents made for them. Here are some of their stories.

I blame Concordia for my success. They were very instrumental in helping me think in a business mind.
