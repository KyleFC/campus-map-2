Saddleback Church started 35 years ago with two young church planters, a dream, and a map. God gave Pastor Rick and Kay Warren the dream to plant a church for people who didn’t like church, and he led them to Southern California. The rest is a history that’s still unfolding.

The PEACE Center, a ministry of Saddleback Church, is a place for people in need of basic resources and assistance. Programs, educational workshops, and services are available to everyone in the community.
