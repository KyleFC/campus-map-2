As future alumni, discover the many generous donors who have supported academic programs and scholarships, and consider how you will make your mark on the students who come after you.

EXPLORE 
Leave a Legacy

Seniors have the opportunity to leave a parting gift to future Concordia students. Your gift can be pooled with other graduates toward a unique initiative, or designated toward the school, college, program, center, or department of your choice that has made an impression on your Concordia experience.

MAKE A GIFT AND LEAVE YOUR LEGACY
Volunteer

Concordia Cares offers students, faculty, and staff opportunities to serve the local community. Our volunteers are members of the Concordia family that share a common passion—to serve their neighbors in need.

GET INVOLVED

On workdays [in the Heritage Garden] we have students, faculty, staff, their children, community members and members of the local Native American tribe working together and having fun. It’s a great way to develop relationships and a sense of shared purpose.

Thea Gavin, English Professor
