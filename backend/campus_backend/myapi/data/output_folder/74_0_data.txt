Our Individual Events Program

According to a growing body of research, public speaking and communication skills are essential for career success. Our individual events program teaches students to overcome their fears of public speaking, while honing competition and research skills that will last a lifetime. We have placed 1st over 156 times, advanced at national tournaments over 72 times, and advanced at tournaments over 1,716 times in the history of our program. For the past 3 years, our program has ranked in the top 10 individual events programs in the country.

Our Debate Program

The political landscape in the United States changes quickly. Our debate program empowers students to stay informed and up-to-date on the current political climate with critical thinking skills and award-winning research techniques. Concordia University Irvine Debate holds two national sweepstakes championships from the National Parliamentary Debate Association, and the National Round Robin 2018 Top Speaker title. Our program is the only team in the country to place students in the top 8 nationwide five years in a row.
