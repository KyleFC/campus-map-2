Mission Statement

Enactus is a worldwide organization of 1,730 universities and 72,000 students committed to helping less fortunate people in the developing world through entrepreneurship activities. The Concordia Enactus Club is eight students strong and growing.

Our club project is to support aspiring entrepreneurs in the Philippines and soon in Costa Rica. Our team analyzes aspirantâ€™s business plans, provide microfinance loans to the final contenders, and coach the recipients of the loans. In May a group of our students travels to the Philippines to meet the aspiring entrepreneurs, teach new candidates and experience the culture and business environment of the Philippines. In doing so, students have the opportunity to help people around the world while developing skills that the workplace values. The Enactus team is featured in the Summer 2018 CUI Magazine.

The Enactus Club is affiliated with the School of Business and Economics.
