About Concordia

Concordia University Irvine prepares students for their vocations—their various callings in life. Concordia University Irvine offers undergraduate, graduate, and online bachelor's degrees in a beautiful Southern California location, with online and regional cohort options. Concordia’s undergraduate program is distinctive among universities in California because of its nationally recognized Core Curriculum, and its Lutheran heritage that provides a thoughtful and caring Christian community that lives out the theology of "Grace Alone. Faith Alone."
