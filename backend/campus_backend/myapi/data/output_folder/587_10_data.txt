Biography

The winningest coach in Rollins soccer history, Dr. Keith Buckley enters his 32nd year at the helm of the Tars program in 2022. His career record of 339-173-34 is the 29th best in the history of NCAA Division II men's soccer and ranks 14th among active coaches. Buckley's win total is the 12th most among active coaches.

A former standout player for the Tars, he has built his alma mater into one of the nation's premier collegiate soccer programs.

Since 2010, Buckley's Tars have posted a record of 133-59-14, won three Sunshine State Conference Championships, three SSC tournament titles, and advanced to the NCAA Tournament seven times. Buckley led the program to new heights in 2010, guiding the Tars to the NCAA Division II National Championship game, finishing runner-up to Northern Kentucky. The match was played in the midst of a Louisville, Kentucky snowstorm and a late goal by the Norse handed the Tars a 2-1 loss.

Also on Buckley's resume are five SSC Coach of the Year Awards and three NSCAA South Region Coach of the Year honors.

Buckley has mentored 18 All-America selections and six SSC Players of the Year, including Daniel Robertson, who is the only Tar to be named All-America three times and SSC Player of the Year twice.

Buckley is a class of 2008 inductee into the Rollins Sports Hall of Fame in honor of his outstanding playing career for the Tars. In March of 2005, Buckley was named Rollins College Director of Physical Education and Assistant Director of Athletics for Academic Leadership.

A standout performer for the Tars from 1984-88, Buckley returned to Rollins as an assistant coach in 1990 and was named head coach prior to the 1991 campaign. After struggling to a 3-13-1 record during his initial season at the helm, Buckley has steered the program back into the regional and national spotlight. He also coached the Rollins women's team during their first two varsity seasons and led them to consecutive 10-victory seasons and a 20-14 overall record.

After getting the men's squad back on the winning track with an 11-7-1 record in 1992, Buckley's teams enjoyed tremendous success over the next four seasons. In 1993 Rollins tied the school record for victories in a season with 14, only to break that mark the following year with a 15-3 record. The 1994 squad received national recognition as they were ranked No. 16 in the country. In 1995, the Tars reached as high as No. 6 in Division II and narrowly missed reaching the NCAA tournament as they finished with a 10-4-3 record. The 1996 squad posted a 10-7-2 record, including an eight match-winning streak during the month of October. After reloading, the Tars posted a 13-5 record during the 1998 season and in 1999 had a 14-4 record, including an impressive 5-2 mark in SSC play.

Buckley's success as a head coach is hardly a surprise considering his outstanding playing career for the Tars. One of the top forwards ever to wear the Blue and Gold, Buckley still ranks among Rollins' career leaders in several categories.

He earned First Team All-SSC honors in 1987 and was named to the second team in 1985 and 1986. He also was named First Team All-State in 1985 and 1986 and was First Team All-Region in 1987.

After graduation, Buckley began his professional career with the Albany Capitals and later played for the Orlando Lions of the American Soccer League (ASL). During the summer of '94, Buckley served as the competition director for five World Cup games held at the Citrus Bowl. In 1996 he was again involved in international soccer competition as he was part of the team that coordinated the Olympic soccer games played at the Citrus Bowl.

A native of London, England, Buckley graduated from Rollins in 1988 and completed his MBA from the Rollins Crummer Graduate School of Business in December 1994. In 2003 Buckley earned his Doctorate in Education from the University of Central Florida.

Buckley has two daughters, Emily Carol and Sarah Elizabeth.

I appreciate the quality of the students and their willingness to accept new ideas.
