Concordia’s Hispanic Leadership Conference is made possible through grants and donations from organizations, in-kind donations, and donations from private donors. As a nonprofit, Concordia is grateful for these contributions; they help us to be better stewards of our funds, and they help first-gen students to pursue college.
