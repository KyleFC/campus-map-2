CONCORDIA FUND
Annual Fund gifts are at the heart of Concordia’s giving tradition.

Investing in the Concordia Fund and student scholarships gives Concordia the flexibility to direct your donation to where it is needed most – benefiting our students through student aid, technology, lab equipment, research opportunities and much more! By giving to a University, you are supporting the emerging generations that shape our future. Their hearts and minds are immeasurable resources containing infinite possibilities for learning, service, and leadership.

Your annual gifts, large and small, provide access to a top Christian education. You can designate your gift to fund the elements that defined your CUI experience or to support need-based scholarships to help others define theirs.

Student Gratitude
Concordia has provided such an awesome opportunity for growth in my faith and my education. I love how the professors genuinely care about you and want to get to know you as an individual.
