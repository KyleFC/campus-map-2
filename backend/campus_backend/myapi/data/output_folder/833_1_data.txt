Supporting your student with a disability

Whether your student is a first year student, transfer, or returner, you can help support your student to be successful. Some questions to ask:

Have you requested accommodations for this semester?
Are you using your accommodations?
Do you need to schedule your exams for accommodations with DAS?
Are you using tutoring or other resources?
Have you checked to see and read any emails you received from DAS?
Have you communicated with your class instructor about accommodations?
Access to Student Information

DAS does not disclose information about students and accommodations to parents or guardians. A student may sign a release with DAS that gives us permission to share information related to the office with parents; however, even with a signed release, students are still responsible for handling matters related to DAS, including registration and accommodations. We do not work with the parent in place of the student.
